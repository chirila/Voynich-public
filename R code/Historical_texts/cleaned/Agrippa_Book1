three books of occult philosophy or of magick written by that famous man henry cornelius agrippa knight and doctor of both laws counsellor to csars sacred majesty and judge of the prerogative court book i chap i how magicians collect vertues from the threefold world is declared in these three books seeing there is a threefold world elementary celestiall and intellectual and every inferior is governed by its superior and receiveth the influence of the vertues thereof so that the very original and chief worker of all doth by angels the heavens stars elements animals plants metals and stones convey from himself the vertues of his omnipotency upon us for whose service he made and created all these things wise men conceive it no way irrationall that it should be possible for us to ascend by the same degrees through each world to the same very originall world it self the maker of all things and first cause from whence all things are and proceed and also to enjoy not only these vertues which are already in the more excellent kind of things but also besides these to draw new vertues from above hence it is that they seek after the vertues of the elementary world through the help of physick medicine and naturall philosophy in the various mixtions of naturall things then of the celestiall world in the rayes and influences thereof according to the rules of astrologers and the doctrines of mathematicians joyning the celestiall vertues to the former moreover they ratifie and confirm all these with the powers of divers intelligencies through the sacred ceremonies of religions the order and process of all these i shall endeavor to deliver in these three books whereof the forst contains naturall magick the second celestiall and the third ceremoniall but i know not whether it be an unpardonable presumption in me that i a man of so little judgement and learning should in my very youth so confidently set upon a business so difficult so hard and intricate as this is wherefore whatsoever things have here already and shall afterward be said by me i would not have any one assent to them nor shall i my self any further then they shall be approved of by the universall church and the congregation of the faithfull chap ii what magick is what are the parts thereof and how the professors thereof must be qualified magick is a faculty of wonderfull vertue full of most high mysteries containing the most profound contemplation of most secret things together with the nature power quality substance and vertues thereof as also the knowledge of whole nature and it doth instruct us concerning the differing and agreement of things amongst themselves whence it produceth its wonderfull effects by uniting the vertues of things through the application of them one to the other and to their inferior sutable subjects joyning and knitting them together thoroughly by the powers and vertues of the superior bodies this is the most perfect and chief science that sacred and sublimer kind of phylosophy philosophy and lastly the most absolute perfection of all most excellent philosophy for seeing that all regulative philosophy is divided into naturall mathematicall and theologicall naturall philosophy teacheth the nature of those things which are in the world searching and enquiring into their causes effects times places fashions events their whole and parts also the number and the nature of those things cald elements what fire earth aire forth brings from whence the heavens their beginnings had whence tide whence rainbow in gay colours clad what makes the clouds that gathered are and black to send forth lightnings and a thundring crack what doth the nightly flames and comets make what makes the earth to swell and then to quake what is the seed of metals and of gold what vertues wealth doth natures coffer hold all these things doth naturall philosophy the viewer of nature contain teaching us according to virgils muse whence all things flow whence mankind beast whence fire whence rain and snow whence earthquakes are why the whole ocean beats over his banks and then again retreats whence strength of hearbs herbs whence courage rage of bruits brutes all kinds of stone of creeping things and fruits but mathematicall philosophy teacheth us to know the quantity of naturall bodies as extended into three dimensions as also to conceive of the motion and course of celestiall bodies as in great hast haste what makes the golden stars to march so fast what makes the moon sometimes to mask her face the sun also as if in some disgrace and as virgil sings how th sun doth rule with twelve zodiack signs the orb thats measurd round about with lines it doth the heavens starry way make known and strange eclipses of the sun and moon arcturus also and the stars of rain the seaven stars likewise and charles his wain why winter suns make towrds the west so fast what makes the nights so long ere they be past all which is understood by mathematicall philosophy hence by the heavens we may foreknow the seasons all times for to reap and sow and when tis fit to launch into the deep and when to war and when in peace to sleep and when to dig up trees and them again to set that so they may bring forth amain now theologicall philosophy or divinity teacheth what god is what the mind what an intelligence what an angel what a divell devil what the soul what religion what sacred institutions rites temples observations and sacred mysteries are it instructs us also concerning faith miracles the vertues of words and figures the secret operations and mysteries of seals and as apuleius saith it teacheth us rightly to understand and to be skilled in the ceremoniall laws the equity of holy things and rule of religions but to recollect my self these three principall faculties magick comprehends unites and actuates deservedly therefore was it by the ancients esteemed as the highest and most sacred philosophy it was as we find brought to light by most sage authours authors and most famous writers amongst which principally zamolxis and zoroaster were so famous that many believed they were the inventors of this science their track footsteps abbaris the hyperborean charmondas damigeron eudoxus hermippus followed there were also other eminent choice men as mercurius tresmegistus trismegistus porphyrius porphyry iamblicus iamblichus plotinus proclus dardanus orpheus the thracian gog the grecian germa the babilonian babylonian apollonius of tyana osthanes also wrote excellently in this art whose books being as it were lost democritus of abdera recovered and set forth with his own commentaries besides pythagoras empedocles democritus plato and many other renowned philosophers travelled far by sea to learn this art and being returned published it with wonderfull devoutness esteeming of it as a great secret also it is well known that pythagoras and plato went to the prophets of memphis to learn it and travelled through almost all syria egypt judea and the schools of the caldeans chaldaeans that they might not be ignorant of the most sacred memorials and records of magick as also that they might be furnished with divine things whosoever therefore is desirous to study in this faculty if he be not skilled in naturall philosophy wherein are discovered the qualities of things and in which are found the occult properties of every being and if he be not skilful in the mathematicks and in the aspects and figures of the stars upon which depends the sublime vertue and property of every thing and if he be not learned in theologie theology wherein are manifested those immateriall substances which dispence dispense and minister all things he cannot be possibly able to understand the rationality of magick for there is no work that is done by meer magick nor any work that is meerly magicall that doth not comprehend these three faculties chap iii of the four elements their qualities and mutuall mixtions there are four elements and originall grounds of all corporeall things fire earth water aire of which all elementated inferiour bodies are compounded not by way of heaping them up together but by transmutation and union and when they are destroyed they are resolved into elements for there is none of the sensible elements that is pure but they are more or less mixed and apt to be changed one into the other even as earth becoming dirty and being dissolved becomes water and the same being made thick and hard becometh earth again but being evaporated through heat passeth into aire and that being kindled passeth into fire and this being extinguished returns back again into aire but being cooled again after its burning becometh earth or stone or sulphur and this is manifested by lightening lightning plato also was of that opinion that earth was wholly changeable and that the rest of the elements are changed as into this so into one another successively but it is the opinion of the subtiller sort of philosophers that earth is not changed but relented and mixed with other elements which do dissolve it and that it returns back into it self again now every one of the elements hath two specificall qualities the former whereof it retains as proper to it self in the other as a mean it agrees with that which comes next after it for fire is hot and dry the earth dry and cold the water cold and moist the aire moist and ot and so after this manner the elements according to two contrary qualities are contrary one to the other as fire to water and earth to aire moreover the elements are upon another account opposite one to the other for some are heavy as earth and water and others are light as aire and fire wherefore the stoicks called the former passives but the latter actives and yet once again plato distinguished them after another manner and assigns to every one of them three qualities viz to the fire brightness thinness and motion but to the earth darkness thickness and quietness and according to these qualities the elements of fire and earth are contrary but the other elements borrow their qualities from these so that the aire receives two qualities of the fire thinness and motion and one of the earth viz darkness in like manner water receives two qualities of the earth darkness and thickness and one of fire viz motion but fire is twice more thin then aire thrice more movable and four times more bright and the aire is twice more bright thrice more thin and four times more moveable then water wherefore water is twice more bright then earth thrice more thin and four times more movable as therefore the fire is to the aire so aire is to the water and water to the earth and again as the earth is to the water so is the water to the aire and the aire to the fire and this is the root and foundation of all bodies natures vertues and wonderfull works and he which shall know these qualities of the elements and their mixtions shall easily bring to pass such things that are wonderfull and astonishing and shall be perfect in magick chap iv of a threefold consideration of the elements there are then as we have said four elements without the perfect knowledge whereof we can effect nothing in magick now each of them is threefold that so the number of four may make up the number of twelve and by passing by the number of seven into the number of ten there may be a progress to the supream unity upon which all vertue and wonderfull operation depends of the first order are the pure elements which are neither compounded nor changed nor admit of mixtion but are incorruptible and not of which but through which the vertues of all naturall things are brought forth into act no man is able to declare their vertues because they can do all things upon all things he which is ignorant of these shall never be able to bring to pass any wonderfull matter of the second order are elements that are compounded changeable and impure yet such as may by art be reduced to their pure simplicity whose vertue when they are thus reduced to their simplicity doth above all things perfect all occult and common operations of nature and these are the foundation of the whole naturall magick of the third order are those elements which originally and of themselves are not elements but are twice compounded various and changeable one into the other they are the infallible medium and therefore are called the middle nature or soul of the middle nature very few there are that understand the deep mysteries thereof in them is by means of certain numbers degrees and orders the perfection of every effect in what thing soever whether naturall celestiall or supercelestiall they are full of wonders and mysteries and are operative as in magick naturall so divine for from these through them proceed the bindings loosings and transmutations of all things the knowing and foretelling of things to come also the driving forth of evill and the gaining of good spirits let no man therefore without these three sorts of elements and the knowledge thereof be confident that he is able to work any thing in the occult sciences of magick and nature but whosoever shall know how to reduce those of one order into those of another impure into pure compounded into simple and shall know how to understand distinctly the nature vertue and power of them in number degrees and order without dividing the substance he shall easily attain to the knowledge and perfect operation of all naturall things and celestiall secrets chap v of the wonderfull natures of fire and earth there are two things saith hermes viz fire and earth which are sufficient for the operation of all wonderfull things the former is active the latter passive fire as saith dionysius in all things and through all things comes and goes away bright it is in all things bright and at the same time occult and unknown when it is by it self no other matter coming to it in which it should manifest its proper action it is boundless and invisible of it self sufficient for every action that is proper to it moveable yielding it self after a maner to all things that come next to it renewing guarding nature enlightening not comprehended by lights that are vailed veiled over clear parted leaping back bending upwards quick in motion high alwayes raising motions comprehending another not comprehended it self not standing in need of another secretly increasing of it self and manifesting its greatness to things that receive it active powerfull invisibly present in all things at once it will not be affronted or opposed but as it were in a way of revenge it will reduce on a sudden things into obedience to it self incomprehensible impalpable not lessened most rich in all disensations of it self fire as saith pliny is the boundless and mischievous part of the nature of things it being a question whether it destroys or produceth most things fire it self is one and penetrates through all things as say the pythagorians also spread abroad in the heavens and shining but in the infernall place streightened dark and tormenting in the mid way it partakes of both fire therefore in it self is one but in that which receives it manifold and in differing subjects it is distributed in a different manner as cleanthes witnesseth in cicero that fire then which we use is fetched out of other things it is in stones and is fetched out by the stroke of the steele it is in earth and makes that after digging up to smoake smoke it is in water and heats springs and wells it is in the depth of the sea and makes that being tossed with winds warm it is in the aire and makes it as we oftentimes see to burn and all animals and living things whatsoever as also all vegetables are preserved by heat and every thing that lives lives by reason of the inclosed heat the properties of the fire that is above are heat making all things fruitfull and light giving life to all things the properties of the infernall fire are a parching heat consuming all things and darkness making all things barren the celestiall and bright fire drives away spirits of darkness also this our fire made with wood drives away the same in as much as it hath an analogy with and is the vehiculum of that superior light as also of him who saith i am the light of the world which is true fire the father of lights from whom every good thing that is given comes sending forth the light of his fire and communicating it first to the sun and the rest of the celestiall bodies and by these as by mediating instruments conveying that light into our fire as therefore the spirits of darkness are stronger in the dark so good spirits which are angels of light are augmented not only by that light which is divine of the sun and celestiall but also by the light of our common fire hence it was that the first and most wise institutors of religions and ceremonies ordained that prayers singings and all manner of divine worships whatsoever should not be performed without lighted candles or torches hence also was that significant saying of pythagoras do not speak of god without a light and they commanded that for the driving away of wicked spirits lights and fires should be kindled by the corpses of the dead and that they should not be removed untill the expiations were after a holy manner performed and they buried and the great jehovah himself in the old law commanded that all his sacrifices should be offered with fire and that fire should always be burning upon the altar which custome the priests of the altar did always observe and keep amongst the romanes now the basis and foundation of all the elements is the earth for that is the object subject and receptacle of all celestiall rayes and influencies in it are contained the seeds and seminall vertues of all things and therefore it is said to be animall vegetable and minerall it being made fruitfull by the other elements and the heavens brings forth all things of it self it receives the abundance of all things and is as it were the first fountain from whence all things spring it is the center foundation and mother of all things take as much of it as you please seperated washed depurated subtilized if you let it lye lie in the open aire a little while it will being full and abounding with heavenly vertues of it self bring forth plants worms and other living things also stones and bright sparks of metals in it are great secrets if at any time it shall be purified by the help of fire and reduced unto its simplicity by a convenient washing it is the first matter of our creation and the truest medicine that can restore and preserve us chap vi of the wonderfull natures of water aire and winds the other two elements viz water and aire are not less efficacious then the former neither is nature wanting to work wonderfull things in them there is so great a necessity of water that without it no living thing can live no hearb herb nor plant whatsoever without the moistening of water can branch forth in it is the seminary vertue of all things especially of animals whose seed is manifestly waterish the seeds also of trees and plants although they are earthy must notwithstanding of necessity be rotted in water before they can be fruitfull whether they be imbibed with the moisture of the earth or with dew or rain or any other water that is on purpose put to them for moses writes that only earth and water bring forth a living soul but he ascribes a twofold production of things to water viz of things swimming in the waters and of things flying in the aire above the earth and that those productions that are made in and upon the earth are partly attributed to the very water the same scripture testifies where it saith that the plants and the hearbs herbs did not grow because god had not caused it to rain upon the earth such is the efficacy of this element of water that spirituall regeneration cannot be done without it as christ himself testified to nicodemus very great also is the vertue of it in the religious worship of god in expiations and purifications yea the necessity of it is no less then that of fire infinite are the benefits and divers are the uses thereof as being that by vertue of which all things subsist are generated nourished and increased thence it was that thales of miletus and hesiod concluded that water was the beginning of all things and said it was the first of all the elements and the most potent and that because it hath the mastery over all the rest for as pliny saith waters swallow up the earth extinguish flames ascend on high and by the stretching forth of the clouds challenge the heaven for their own the same falling become the cause of all things that grow in the earth very many are the wonders that are done by waters according to the writings of pliny solinus and many other historians of the wonderfull vertue whereof ovid also makes mention in these verses hornd hammons waters at high noon are cold hot at sunrise and setting sun wood put in bubling athemas is fird the moon then farthest from the sun retird circonian streams congeal his guts to stone that thereof drinks and what therein is thrown crathis and sybaris from the mountains rold color the hair like amber or pure gold some fountains of a more prodigious kinde not only change the body but the minde who hath not heard of obscene salmacis of th thiopian lake for who of this but only tast taste their wits no longer keep or forthwith fall into a deadly sleep who at clitorius fountain thirst remove loath wine and abstinent meer water love with streams opposd to these lincestus flowes they reel as drunk who drink too much of those a lake in fair arcadia stands of old calld pheneus suspected as twofold fear and forbear to drink thereof by night by night unwholesome wholesome by daylight josephus also makes relation of the wonderfull nature of a certain river betwixt arcea and raphanea cities of syria which runs with a full channell all the sabboth sabbath day and then on a sudden ceaseth as if the springs were stopped and all the six dayes you may pass over it dryshod but again on the seaventh day no man knowing the reason of it the waters return again in abundance as before wherefore the inhabitants thereabout called it the sabbothday river because of the seaventh day which was holy to the jews the gospel also testifies to a sheeppool into which whosoever stepped first after the water was troubled by the angel was made whole of whatsoever disease he had the same vertue and efficacy we read was in a spring of the ionian nymphs which was in the territories belonging to the town of elis at a village called heraclea neer the river citheron which whosoever stepped into being diseased came forth whole and cured of all his diseases pausanias also reports that in lyceus a mountain of arcadia there was a spring called agria to which as often as the dryness of the region threatned threatened the destruction of fruits jupiters priest of lyceus went and after the offering of sacrifices devoutly praying to the waters of the spring holding a bough of an oke oak in his hand put it down to the bottome of the hallowed spring then the waters being troubled a vapour ascending from thence into the air was blown into clouds with which being joyned together the whole heaven was overspread which being a little after dissolved into rain watered all the country most wholsomly wholesomely moreover ruffus a physitian physician of ephesus besides many other authours wrote strange things concerning the wonders of waters which for ought i know are found in no other authour it remains that i speak of the aire this is a vitall spirit passing through all beings giving life and subsistence to all things binding moving and filling all things hence it is that the hebrew doctors reckon it not amongst the elements but count it as a medium or glew glue joyning things together and as the resounding spirit of the worlds instrument it immediately receives into it self the influences of all celestiall bodies and then communicates them to the other elements as also to all mixt mixed bodies also it receives into it self as it were a divine lookingglass the species of all things as well naturall as artificiall as also of all manner of speeches and retains them and carrying them with it and entering into the bodies of men and other animals through their pores makes an impression upon them as well when they sleep as when they be awake and affords matter for divers strange dreams and divinations hence they say it is that a man passing by a place where a man was slain or the carkase carcass newly hid is moved with fear and dread because the aire in that place being full of the dreadfull species of manslaughter manslaughter doth being breathed in move and trouble the spirit of the man with the like species whence it is that be comes to be afraid for every thing that makes a sudden impression astonisheth nature whence it is that many philosophers were of opinion that aire is the cause of dreams and of many other impressions of the mind through the prolonging of images or similitudes or species which are fallen from things and speeches multiplyed in the very aire untill they come to the senses and then to the phantasy and soul of him that receives them which being freed from cares and no way hindred expecting to meet such kind of species is informed by them for the species of things although of their own proper nature they are carryed to the senses of men and other animals in generall may notwithstanding get some impression from the heaven whilest they be in the aire by reason of which together with the aptness and disposition of him that receives them they may be carryed to the sence sense of one rather then of another and hence it is possible naturally and far from all manner of superstition no other spirit coming between that a man should be able in a very time to signifie his mind unto another man abiding at a very long and unknown distance from him although he cannot precisely give an estimate of the time when it is yet of necessity it must be within hours and i my self know how to do it and have often done it the same also in time past did the abbot tritemius trithemius both know and do also when certain appearances not only spirituall but also naturall do flow forth from things that is to say by a certain kind of flowings forth of bodies from bodies and do gather strength in the air they offer and shew themselves to us as well through light as motion as well to the sight as to other senses and sometimes work wonderfull things upon us as plotinus proves and teacheth and we see how by the south wind the air is condensed into thin clouds in which as in a lookingglass are reflected representations at a great distance of castles mountains horses and men and other things which when the clouds are gone presently vanish and aristotle in his meteors shews that a rainbow is conceived in a cloud of the aire as in a lookingglass and albertus saith that the effigies of bodies may by the strength of nature in a moist aire be easily represented in the same manner as the representations of things are in things and aristotle tels of a man to whom it happened by reason of the weakness of his sight that the aire that was near to him became as it were a lookingglass to him and the optick beam did relect back upon himself and could not penetrate the aire so that whithersoever he went he thought he saw his own image with his face towards him go before him in like manner by the artificialnes of some certain lookingglasses may be produced at a distance in the aire beside the lookingglasses what images we please which when ignorant men see they think they see the appearances of spirits or souls when indeed they are nothing else but semblances kin to themselves and without life and it is well known if in a dark place where there is no light but by the coming in of a beam of the sun somewhere through a litle hole a white paper or plain lookingglass be set up against that light that there may be seen upon them whatsoever things are done without being shined upon by the sun and there is another sleight or trick yet more wonderfull if any one shall take images artificially painted or written letters and in a clear night set them against the beams of the full moon whose resemblances being multiplyed in the aire and caught upward and reflected back together with the beams of the moon any other man that is privy to the thing at a long distance sees reads and knows them in the very compass and circle of the moon which art of declaring secrets is indeed very profitable for towns and cities that are besieged being a thing which pythagoras long since did often do and which is not unknown to some in these dayes i will not except my self and all these and many more and greater then these are grounded in the very nature of the aire and have their reasons and causes declared in mathematicks and opticks and as these resemblances are reflected back to the sight so also sometimes to the hearing as is manifest in the echo but there are more secret arts then these and such whereby any one may at a very remote distance hear and understand what another speaks or whispers softly there are also from the airy element winds for they are nothing else but air moved and stirred up of these there are four that are principall blowing from the four corners of the heaven viz notus from the south boreas from the north zephyrus from the west eurus from the east which pontanus comprehending in these verses saith cold boreas from the top of lympus olympus blows and from the bottom cloudy notus flows from setting phoebus fruitfull zephrus flies and barren eurus from the suns uprise notus is the southern wind cloudy moist warm and sickly which hieronimus cals the butler of the rains ovid describes it thus out flies southwind with dropping wings who shrowds his fearful aspect in the pitchie clouds his white haire streams his beard bigswoln with showres showers mists binde his brows rain from his bosome powres pours but boreas is contrary to notus and is the northern wind fierce and roaring and discussing clouds makes the aire serene and binds the water with frost him doth ovid thus bring in speaking of himself force me befits with this thick cloud i drive toss the blew billows knotty okes oaks uprive congeal soft snow and beat the earth with haile when i my brethren in the aire assaile for thats our field we meet with such a shock that thundring skies with our encounters rock and cloudstruck lightning flashes from on high when through the crannies of the earth i flie and force her in her hollow caves i make the ghosts to tremble and the ground to quake and zephyrus which is the western wind is most soft blowing from the west with a pleasant gale it is cold and moist removing the effects of winter bringing forth branches and flowers to this eurus is contrary which is the eastern wind and is called apeliotes it is waterish cloudy and ravenous of these two ovid sings thus to persis and sabea eurus flies whose gums perfume the blushing mornes uprise next to the evening and the coast that glows with setting phoebus flowry zephrus blows in scythia horrid boreas holds his rain beneath boites and the frozen wain the land to this opposd doth auster steep with fruitfull showres and clouds which ever weep chap vii of the kinds of compounds what relation they stand in to the elements and what relation there is betwixt the elements themselves and the soul senses and dispositions of men next after the four simple elements follow the four kinds of perfect bodies compounded of them and they are stones metals plants and animals and although unto the generation of each of these all the elements meet together in the composition yet every one of them follows and resembles one of the elements which is most predominant for all stones are earthy for they are naturally heavy and descend and so hardened with dryness that they cannot be melted but metals are waterish and may be melted which naturalists confess and chymists chemists finde to be true viz that they are generated of a viscous water or waterish argent vive plants have such an affinity with the aire that unless they be abroad in the open aire they do neither bud nor increase so also all animals have in their natures a most fiery force and also spring from a celestiall source and fire is so naturall to them that that being extinguished they presently dye die and again every one of those kinds is distinguished within it self by reason of degrees of the elements for amongst the stones they especially are called earthy that are dark and more heavy and those waterish which are transparent and are compacted of water as crystall beryll and pearls in the shels shells of fishes and they are called airy which swim upon the water and are spongious spongeous as the stones of a sponge the pumice stone and the stone sophus and they are called fiery out of which fire is extracted or which are resolved into fire or which are produced of fire as thunderbolts firestones and the stone asbestus asbestos also amongst metals lead and silver are earthy quicksilver is waterish copper and tin are airy and gold and iron are fiery in plants also the roots resemble the earth by reason of their thickness and the leaves water because of their juice flowers the aire because of their subtility and the seeds the fire by reason of their multiplying spirit besides they are called some hot wine cold sonic moist some dry borrowing their names from the qualifies of the elements amongst animals also some are in comparison of others earthy and dwell in the bowels of the earth as worms and moles and many other small creeping vermine others are watery as fishes others airy which cannot live out of the aire others also are fiery living in the fire as salamanders and crickets such as are of a fiery heat as pigeons estriches ostriches lions and such as the wise man cals beasts breathing fire besides in animals the bones resemble the earth flesh the aire the vital spirit the fire and the humors the water and these humors also partake of the elements for yellow choller choler is instead of fire blood instead of aire flegme phlegm instead of water and black choller choler or melancholy instead of earth and lastly in the soul it self according to austin augustine the understanding resembles fire reason the aire imagination the water and the senses the earth and these senses also are divided amongst themselves by reason of the elements for the sight is fiery neither can it perceive without fire and light the hearing is airy for a sound is made by the striking of the aire the smell and tast taste resemble the water without the moisture of which there is neither smell nor tast taste and lastly the feeling is wholly earthy and taketh gross bodies for its object the actions also and the operations of man are governed by the elements the earth signifies a slow and firm motion the water signifies fearfulness & sluggishness and remisseness in working aire signifies chearfulness cheerfulness and an amiable disposition but fire a fierce quick and angry disposition the elements therefore are the first of all things and all things are of and according to them and they are in all things and diffuse their vertues through all things chap viii how the elements are in the heavens in stars in divels devils in angels and lastly in god himself it is the unanimous consent of all platonists that as in the originall and exemplary world all things are in all so also in this corporeal world all things are in all so also the elements are not only in these inferior bodies but also in the heavens in stars in divels devils in angels and lastly in god the maker and originall example of all things now in these inferiour bodies the elements are accompanied with much gross matter but in the heavens the elements are with their natures and vertues viz after a celestiall and more excellent manner then in sublunary things for the firmness of the celestiall earth is there without the grossness of water and the agility of the aire without running over its bounds the heat of fire without burning only shining and giving life to all things by its heat amongst the stars also some are fiery as mars and sol airy as jupiter and venus watery as saturn and mercury and earthy such as inhabit the eighth orbe and the moon which notwithstanding by many is accounted watery seeing as if it were earth it attracts to it self the celestiall waters with which being imbibed it doth by reason of its neerness nearness to us power pour out and communicate to us there are also amongst the signes some fiery some earthy some airy some watery the elements rule them also in the heavens distributing to them these four threefold considerations of every element viz the beginning middle and end so aries possesseth the beginning of fire leo the progress and increase and sagittarius the end taurus the beginning of the earth virgo the progress capricorn the end gemini the beginning of the aire libra the progress aquarius the end cancer the beginning of water scorpius scorpio the middle and pisces the end of the mixtions therefore of these planets and signes together with the elements are all bodies made moreover divels devils also are upon this account distinguished the one from the other so that some are called fiery some earthy some airy and some watery hence also those four infernall rivers fiery phlegethon airy cocytus watery styx earthy acheron also in the gospel we read of hell fire and eternall fire into which the cursed shall be commanded to go and in the revelation we read of a lake of fire and isaiah speaks of the damned that the lord will smite them with corrupt aire and in job they shall skip from the waters of the snow to extremity of heat and in the same we read that the earth is dark and covered with the darkness of death and miserable darkness moreover also these elements are placed in the angels in heaven and the blessed intelligencies there is in them a stability of their essence which is an earthly vertue in which is the stedfast seat of god also their mercy and piety is a watery cleansing vertue hence by the psalmist they are called waters where he speaking of the heavens saith who rulest the waters that are higher then the heavens ps also in them their subtill subtle breath is aire and their love is shining fire hence they are called in scripture the wings of the wind and in another place the psalmist speaks of them who makest angels thy spirits and thy ministers a flaming fire also according to orders of angels some are fiery as seraphin seraphim and authorities and powers earthy as cherubin cherubim watery as thrones and archangels airy as dominions and principalities do we not also read of the original maker of all things that the earth shall he opened and bring forth a saviour is it not spoken of the same that he shall be a fountain of living water cleansing and regenerating is not the same spirit breathing the breath of life and the same according to moses and pauls testimony a consuming fire that elements therefore are to be found every where and in all things after their manner no man can deny first in these inferiour bodies feculent and gross and in celestials more pure and clear but in supercelestials living and in all respects blessed elements therefore in the exemplary world are ideas of things to be produced in intelligencies are distributed powers in heavens are vertues and in inferiour bodies gross forms chap ix of the vertues of things naturall depending immediatly upon elements of the naturall vertues of things some are elementary as to heat to cool to moisten to dry and they are called operations or first qualities and the second act for these qualities only do wholly change the whole substance which none of the other qualities can do and some are in things compounded of elements and these are more then first qualities and such are those that are maturating digesting resolving mollifying hardening restringing absterging corroding burning opening evaporating strengthening mitigating conglutinating obstructing expelling retaining attracting repercussing stupifying stupefying bestowing lubrifying and many more elementary qualities do many things in a mixt mixed body which they cannot do in the elements themselves and these operations are called secondary qualities because they follow the nature and proportion of the mixtion of the first vertues as largely it is treated of in physick medical books as maturation which is the operation of naturall heat according to a certain proportion in the substance of the matter induration is the operation of cold so also is congelation and so of the rest and these operations sometimes act upon a certain member as such which provoke urine milk the menstrua and they are called third qualities which follow the second as the second do the first according therefore to these first second and third qualities many diseases are both cured and caused many things also there are artificially made which men much wonder at as is fire which burns water which they call the greek fire of which aristotle teacheth many compositions in his particular treatise of this subject in like manner there is made a fire that is extinguished with oyl oil and is kindled with cold water when it is sprinkled upon it and a fire which is kindled either with rain wind or the sun and there is made a fire which is called burning water the confection whereof is well known and it consumes nothing but it self and also there are made fires that cannot be quenched and incombustible oyles oils and perpetuall lamps which can be extinguished neither with wind nor water nor any other way which seems utterly incredible but that there had been such a most famous lamp which once did shine in the temple of venus in which the stone asbestos did burn which being once fired can never be extinguished also on the contrary wood or any other combustible matter may be so ordered that it can receive no harm from the fire and there are made certain confections with which the hands being anointed we may carry red hot iron in them or put them into melted metall or go with our whole bodies being first anointed therewith into the fire without any manner of harm and such like things as these may be done there is also a kind of flax which pliny calls asbestum the greeks call asbezon which is not consumed by fire of which anaxilaus saith that a tree compassed about with it may be cut down with insensible blows that cannot be heard chap x of the occult vertues of things there are also other vertues in things which are not from any element as to expell poyson poison to drive away the noxious vapours of minerals to attract iron or any thing else and these vertues are a sequell of the species and form of this or that thing whence also they being little in quantity are of great efficacy which is not granted to any elementary quality for these vertues having much form and litle matter can do very much but an elementary vertue because it hath more materiality requires much matter for its acting and they are called occult qualities because their causes lie hid and mans intellect cannot in any way reach and find them out wherefore philosophers have attained to the greatest part of them by long experience rather then by the search of reason for as in the stomack stomach the meat is digested by heat which we know so it is changed by a certain hidden vertue which we know not for truly it is not changed by heat because then it should rather be changed by the fire side then in the stomack stomach so there are in things besides the elementary qualities which we know other certain imbred vertues created by nature which we admire and are amazed at being such as we know not and indeed seldom or never have seen as we read in ovid of the phoenix one only bird which renews her self all birds from others do derive their birth but yet one fowle there is in all the earth calld by th assyrians phoenix who the wain of age repairs and sows her self again and in another place gyptus came to see this wondrous sight and this rare bird is welcomd with delight long since metreas matreas brought a very great wonderment upon the greeks and romans concerning himself he said that he nourished and bred a beast that did devour it self hence many to this day are solicitous what this beast of matreas should be who would not wonder that fishes should be digged out of the earth of which aristotle theophrastus and polybius the historian makes mention and those things which pausanius wrote concerning the singing stones all these are effects of occult vertues so the estrich ostrich concocts cold and most hard iron and digests it into nourishment for his body whose stomack stomach they also report cannot be hurt with red hot iron so that little fish called echeneis doth so curb the violence of the winds and appease the rage of the sea that let the tempests be never so imperious and raging the sails also bearing a full gale it doth notwithstanding by its meer touch stay the ships and makes them stand still that by no means they can be moved so salamanders and crickets live in the fire although they seem sometimes to burn yet they are not hurt the like is said of a kind of bitumen with which the weapons of the amazons were said to be smeared over by which means they could be spoiled neither with sword nor fire with which also the gates of caspia made of brass are reported to be smeared over by alexander the great we read also that noahs ark was joyned together with this bitumen and that it endured some thousands of years upon the mountains of armenia there are many such kind of wonderfull things scarce credible which notwithstanding are known by experience amongst which antiquity makes mention of satyrs which were animals in shape half men and half bruits brutes yet capable of speech and reason one whereof s hierome reporteth spake once unto holy antonius the hermite and condemned the errour of the gentiles in worshipping such poor creatures as they were and desired him that he would pray unto the true god for him also he affirms that there was one of them shewed openly alive and afterwards sent to constantine the emperour chap xi how occult vertues are infused into the severall kinds of things by ideas through the help of the soul of the world and rayes of the stars and what things abound most with this vertue platonists say that all inferiour bodies are exemplified by the superiour ideas now they define an idea to be a form above bodies souls minds and to be one simple pure immutable indivisible incorporeal and eternall and that the nature of all ideas is the same now they place ideas in the first place in very goodness it self ie god by way of cause and that they are distinguished amongst themselves by some relative considerations only least whatsoever is in the world should be but one thing without any variety and that they agree in essence least god should be a compound substance in the second place they place them in the very intelligible it self ie in the soul of the world differing the one from the other by absolute forms so that all the ideas in god indeed are but one form but in the soul of the world they are many they are placed in the minds of all other things whether they be joyned to the body or separated from the body by a certain participation and now by degrees are distinguished more and more they place them in nature as certain small seed of forms infused by the ideas and lastly they place them in matter as shadows hereunto may be added that in the soul of the world there be as many seminal forms of things as ideas in the mind of god by which forms she did in the heavens above the stars frame to her self shapes also and stamped upon all these some properties on these stars therefore shapes and properties all vertues of inferiour species as also their properties do depend so that every species hath its celestiall shape or figure that is sutable suitable to it from which also proceeds a wonderfull power of operating which proper gift it receives from its own idea through the seminal forms of the soul of the world for ideas are not only essential causes of every species but are also the causes of every vertue which is in the species and this is that which many philosophers say that the properties which are in the nature of things which vertues indeed are the operations of the ideas are moved by certain vertues viz such as have a certain and sure foundation not fortuitous nor casuall but efficacious powerfull and sufficient doing nothing in vain now these vertues do not err in their actings but by accident viz by reason of the impurity or inequality of the matter for upon this account there are found things of the same species more or less powerful according to the purity or indisposition of the matter for all celestial influences may be hindred by the indisposition and insufficiency of the matter whence it was a proverb amongst the platonists that celestial vertues were infused according to the desert of the matter which also virgil makes mention of when he sings their natures fiery are and from above and from gross bodies freed divinely move wherefore those things in which there is less of the idea of the matter ie such things which have a greater resemblance of things separated have more powerfull vertues in operation being like to the operation of a separated idea we see then that the situation and figure of celestials is the cause of all those excellent vertues that are in inferiour species chap xii how it is that particular vertues are infused into particular individuals even of the same species there are also in many individuals or particular things peculiar gifts as wonderfull as in the species and these also are from the figure and situation of celestiall stars for every individuall when it begins to be under a determined horoscope and celestiall constellation contracts together with its essence a certain wonderfull vertue both of doing and suffering something that is remarkable even besides that which it receives from its species and this it doth partly by the influence of the heaven and partly through that obedientialness of the matter of things to be generated to the soul of the world which obedientialness indeed is such as that of our bodies to our souls for we perceive that there is this in us that according to our conceptions of things our bodies are moved and that cheerfully as when we are afraid of or fly from any thing so many times when the celestiall souls conceive several things then the matter is moved obedientially to it also in nature there appear divers prodigies by reason of the imagination of superiour motions so also they conceive & imagine divers vertues not only things naturall but also sometimes things artificial and this especially if the soul of the operator be inclined towards the same whence avicen saith that whatsoever things are done here must have been before in the motions and conceptions of the stars and orbes so in things various effects inclinations and dispositions are occasioned not only from the matter variously disposed as many suppose but from a various influence and diverse form not truly with a specifical difference but peculiar and proper and the degrees of these are variously distributed by the first cause of all things god himself who being unchangeable distributes to every one as he pleaseth with whom notwithstanding second causes angelical and celestial cooperate disposing of the corporeal matter and other things that are committed to them all vertues therefore are infused by god through the soul of the world yet by a particular power of resemblances and intelligences overruling them and concourse of the rayes and aspects of the stars in a certain peculiar harmonious consent chap xiii whence the occult vertues of things proceed it is well known to all that there is a certain vertue in the loadstone by which it attracts iron and that the diamond doth by its presence take away that vertue of the loadstone so also amber and jeat jet rubbed and warmed draw a straw to them and the stone asbestus asbestos being once fired is never or scarce extinguished a carbuncle shines in the dark the stone aetites put above the young fruit of women or plants strengthens them but being put under causeth abortion the jasper stencheth stauncheth blood the litle fish echeneis stops the ships rhubarb expels choller choler the liver of the camelion chameleon burnt raiseth showers and thunders the stone heliotrope dazles dazzles the sight and makes him that wears it to be invisible the stone lyucurius takes away delusions from before the eyes the perfume of the stone lypparis cals forth all the beasts the stone synochitis brings up infernal ghosts the stone anachitis makes the images of the gods appear the ennecis put under them that dream causeth oracles there is an hearb herb in thiopia ethiopia with which they report ponds and lakes are dryed dried up and all things that are shut to be opened and we read of an hearb herb called latace which the persian kings give to their embassadours that whithersoever they shall come they shall abound with plenty of all things there is also a scythian hearb herb with which being tasted or at least held in the mouth they report the scythians will endure twelve dayes hunger and thirst and apuleius saith that he was taught by an oracle that there were many kinds of hearbs herbs and stones with which men might prolong their lives for ever but that it was not lawfull for men to understand the knowledge of those things because whereas they have but a short time to live they study mischief with all their might and attempt all manner of wickedness if they should be sure of a very long time they would not spare the gods themselves but from whence these vertues are none of all these have shewed who have set forth huge volumes of the properties of things not hermes not bochus not aaron not orpheus not theophrastus not thebith not zenothemis not zoroaster not evax not dioscorides not isaaick the jew not zacharias the babilonian babylonian not albertus not arnoldus and yet all these have confessed the same that zacharias writes to mithridites that great power and humane destinies are couched in the vertues of stones and hearbs herbs but to know from whence these come a higher speculation is required alexander the peripateticke not going any further then his senses and qualities is of the opinion that these proceed from elements and their qualities which haply might be supposed to be true if those were of the same species but many of the operations of the stones agree neither in genere nor specie therefore plato and his schollers scholars attribute these vertues to ideas the formers of things but avicen reduceth these kinds of operations to intelligencies hermes to the stars albertus to the specificall forms of things and although these authors seem to thwart one the other yet none of them if they be rightly understood goes beside the truth since all their sayings are the same in effect in most things for god in the first place is the end and begining of all vertues he gives the seal of the ideas to his servants the intelligencies who as faithfull officers sign all things intrusted entrusted to them with an ideall vertue the heavens and stars as instruments disposing the matter in the mean while for the receiving of those forms which reside in divine majesty as saith plato in timeus and to be conveyed by stars and the giver of forms distributes them by the ministry of his intelligencies which he hath set as rulers and controllers over his works to whom such a power is intrusted in things committed to them that so all vertues of stones hearbs herbs metals and all other things may come from the intelligencies the governours the form therefore and vertue of things comes first from the ideas then from the ruling and governing intelligencies then from the aspects of the heavens disposing and lastly from the tempers of the elements disposed answering the influencies of the heavens by which the elements themselves are ordered or disposed these kinds of operations therefore are performed in these inferiour things by express forms and in the heavens by disposing vertues in intelligencies by mediating rules in the original cause by ideas and exemplary forms all which must of necessity agree in the execution of the effect and vertue of every thing there is therefore a wonderfull vertue and operation in every hearb herb and stone but greater in a star beyond which even from the governing intelligencies every thing receiveth and obtains many things for it self especially from the supream cause with whom all things do mutually and exactly correspond agreeing in an harmonious consent as it were in hymnes alwaies praising the highest maker of all things as by the three children in the fiery furnace were all things called upon to praise god with singings bless ye the lord all things that grow upon the earth and all things which move in the waters all fowls of the heavens beasts and cattle together with the sons of men there is therefore no other cause of the necessity of effects then the connexion connection of all things with the first cause and their correspondency with those divine patterns and eternall ideas whence every thing hath its determinate and particular place in the exemplary world from whence it lives and receives its originall being and every vertue of hearbs herbs stones metals animals words and speeches and all things that are of god is placed there now the first cause which is god although he doth by intelligencies and the heavens work upon these inferiour things doth sometimes these mediums being laid aside or their officiating being suspended works those things immediatly by himself which works then are called miracles but whereas secondary causes which plato and others call handmaids do by the command and appointment of the first cause necessarily act and are necessitated to produce their effects if god shall notwithstanding according to his pleasure so discharge and suspend them that they shall wholly desist from the necessity of that command and appointment then they are called the greatest miracles of god so the fire in the chaldeans furnace did not burn the children so also the sun at the command of joshua went back from its course the space of one whole day so also at the prayer of hezekiah it went back ten degrees or hours so when christ was crucified the sun was darkened though at full moon and the reasons these operations can by no rationall discourse no magick or occult or profound science whatsoever be found out or understood but are to be learned and inquired into by divine oracles only chap xiv of the spirit of the world what it is and how by way of medium it unites occult vertues to their subjects democritus and orpheus and many pythagorians having most diligently searched into the vertues of celestiall things and natures of inferior things said that all things are full of god and not without cause for there is nothing of such transcending vertues which being destitute of divine assistance is content with the nature of it self also they called those divine powers which are diffused in things gods which zoroaster called divine allurements synesius symbolicall inticements others called them lives and some also souls saying that the vertues of things did depend upon these because it is the property of the soul to be from one matter extended into divers things about which it operates so is a man who extends his intellect unto intelligible things and his imagination unto imaginable things and this is that which they understood when they said viz that the soul of one thing went out and went into another thing altering it and hindering the operations of it as the diamond hinders the operation of the loadstone that it cannot attract iron now seeing the soul is the first thing that is moveable and as they say is moved of it self but the body or the matter is of it self unable and unfit for motion and doth much degenerate from the soul therefore they say there is need of a more excellent medium viz such a one that may be as it were no body but as it were a soul or as it were no soul but as it were a body viz by which the soul may be joyned to the body now they conceive such a medium to be the spirit of the world viz that which we call the quintessence because it is not from the four elements but a certain first thing having its being above and besides them there is therefore such a kind of spirit required to be as it were the medium whereby celestiall souls are joyned to gross bodies and bestow upon them wonderfull gifts this spirit is after the same manner in the body of the world as ours is in the body of man for as the powers of our soul are communicated to the members of the body by the spirit so also the vertue of the soul of the world is diffused through all things by the quintessence for there is nothing found in the whole world that hath not a spark of the vertue thereof yet it is more nay most of all infused into those things which have received or taken in most of this spirit now this spirit is received or taken in by the rayes of the stars so far forth as things render themselves conformable to them by this spirit therefore every occult property is conveyed into hearbs herbs stones metals and animals through the sun moon planets and through stars higher then the planets now this spirit may be more advantageous to us if any one knew how to separate it from the elements or at least to use those things chiefly which do most abound with this spirit for these things in which this spirit is less drowned in a body and less checked by matter do more powerfully and perfectly act and also more readily generate their like for in it are all generative & seminary vertues for which cause the alchymists alchemists endeavour to separate this spirit from gold and silver which being rightly separated and extracted if thou shalt afterward project upon any matter of the same kind ie any metall presently will turn it into gold or silver and we know how to do that and have seen it done but we could make no more gold then the weight of that was out of which we extracted the spirit for seeing that is an extense form and not intense it cannot beyond its own bounds change and imperfect body into a perfect which i deny not but may be done by another way chap xv how we must find out and examine the vertues of things by way of similitude it is now manifest that the occult properties in things are not from the nature of the elements but infused from above hid from our senses and scarce at last known by our reason which indeed come from the life and the spirit of the world through the rayes of the stars and can no otherwise but by experience and conjecture be enquired into by us wherefore he that desires to enter upon this study must consider that every thing moves and turns it self to its like and inclines that to it self with all its might as well in property viz occult vertue as in quality viz elementary vertue sometimes also in substance it self as we see in salt for whatsoever hath long stood with salt becomes salt for every agent when it hath begun to act doth not attempt to make a thing inferiour to it self but as much as may be like and sutable suitable to it self which also we manifestly see in sensible animals in which the nutritive vertue doth not change the meat into an hearb herb or a plant but turns it into sensible flesh in what things therefore there is an excess of any quality or property as heat cold boldness fear sadness anger love hatred or any other passion or vertue whether it be in them by nature or sometimes also by art or chance as boldness in a harlot these things do very much move and provoke to such a quality passion or vertue so fire moves to fire and water moves to water and be that is bold moves to boldness and it is well known amongst physitians physicians that brain helps the brain and lungs the lungs so also it is said that the right eye of a frog helps the soreness of a mans right eye and the left eye thereof helps the soreness of his left eye if they be hanged about his neck in a cloth of its naturall colour the like is reported of the eyes of a crab so the foot of a tortoise helps them that have the gout in their being applyed thus as foot to foot hand to hand right to right left to left after this manner they say that any animall that is barren causeth another to be barren and of the animall especially the testicles matrix womb or urin urine so they report that a woman shall not conceive if she drink every moneth of the urin urine of a mule or any thing steeped in it if therefore we would obtain any property or vertue let us seek for such animals or such other things whatsoever in which such a property is in a more eminent manner then in any other thing and in these let us take that part in which such a property or vertue is most vigorous as if at any time we would promote love let us seek some animall which is most loving of which kind are pigeons turtles sparrows swallows wagtailes and in these take those members or parts in which the venerall venereal ie sexual appetite is most vigorous such as the heart testicles matrix womb yard penis sperme and menstrues and it must be done at that time when these animals have this affection most intense for then they do provoke and draw love in like manner to increase boldness let us look for a lyon lion or a cock and of these let us take the heart eyes or forehead and so we must understand that which psellus the platonist saith viz that dogs crows and cocks conduce much to watchfulness also the nightingale and bat and horn owle horned owl and in these the heart head and eyes especially therefore it is said if any shall carry the heart of a crow or a bat about him he shall not sleep till he cast it away from him the same doth the head of a bat dryed dried and bound to the right arme of him that is awake for if it be put upon him when he is asleep it is said that he shall not be awaked till it be taken off from him after the same manner doth a frog and an owle make one talkative and of these specially the tongue and heart so the tongue also of a waterfrog laid under the head makes a man speak in his sleep and the heart of a scrichowle screechowl laid upon the left breast of a woman that is asleep is said to make her utter all her secrets the same also the heart of the horn owle horned owl is said to do also the sewet suet of a hare laid upon the breast of one that is asleep upon the same account do animals that are long lived conduce to long life and whatsoever things have a power in themselves to renew themselves conduce to the renovation of our body and restoring of youth which physitians physicians have often professed they know to be true as is manifest of the viper and snake and it is known that harts renew their old age by the eating of snakes after the same manner the phoenix is renewed by a fire which she makes for her self and the like vertue there is in a pellican pelican whose right foot being put under warm dung after three moneths months there is of that generated a pellican pelican therefore some physitians physicians by some certain confections made of vipers and hellebor hellebore and the flesh of some such kind of animals do restore youth and indeed do sometimes restore it so as medea restored old pileas it is also believed that the blood of a bear if it be sucked out of her wound doth increase strength of body because that animall is the strongest creature chap xvi how the operations of several vertues pass from one thing into another and are communicated one to the other thou must know that so great is the power of naturall things that they not only work upon all things that are neer them by their vertue but also besides this they infuse into them a like power through which by the same vertue they also work upon other things as we see in the loadstone which stone indeed doth not only draw iron rings but also infuseth a vertue into the rings themselves whereby they can do the same which austin augustine and albertus magnus say they saw after this manner it is as they say that a common harlot grounded in boldness and impudence doth infect all that are neer her by this property whereby they are made like her self therefore they say that if any one shall put on the inward garment of an harlot or shall have about him that looking glass which she daily looks into he shall thereby become bold confident impudent and wanton in like manner they say that a cloth that was about a dead corpse hath received from thence the property of sadness and melancholy and that the halter wherewith a man was hanged hath certain wonderfull properties the like story tels pliny if any shall put a green lizard made blind together with iron or gold rings into a glassvessel putting under them some earth and then shutting the vessel and when it appears that the lizard hath received his sight shall put him out of the glass that those rings shall help sore eyes the same may be done with rings and a weesel weasel whose eyes after they are with any kind of prick put out it is certain are restored to sight again upon the same account rings are put for a certain time in the nest of sparrows or swallows which afterwards are used to procure love and favor chap xvii how by enmity and friendship the vertues of things are to be tryed and found out in the next place it is requisite that we consider that all things have a friendliness and enmity amongst themselves and every thing hath something that it fears & dreads that is an enemy and destructive to it and on the contrary something that it rejoyceth and delighteth in and is strengthened by so in the elements fire is an enemy to water and aire to earth but yet they agree amongst themselves and again in celestiall bodies mercury jupiter the sun and moon are friends to saturn mars and venus enemies to him all the planets besides mars are friends to jupiter also all besides venus hate mars jupiter and venus love the sun mars mercury and the moon are enemies to him all besides saturne love venus jupiter venus and saturne are friends to mercury the sun moon and mars his enemies jupiter venus saturne are friends to the moon mars and mercury her enemies there is another kind of enmity amongst the stars viz when they have opposite houses as saturne to the sun and moon jupiter to mercury mars to venus and their enmity is stronger whose exaltations are opposite as of saturne and the sun of jupiter and mars of venus and mercury but their friendship is the strongest who agree in nature quality substance and power as mars with the sun as venus with the moon as jupiter with venus as also their friendship whose exaltation is in the house of another as that of saturne with venus of jupiter with the moon of mars with saturn of the sun with mars of venus with jupiter of the moon with venus and of what sort the friendships and enmities of the superiours be such are the inclinations of things subjected to them in these inferiour these dispositions therefore of friendship and enmity are nothing else but certain inclinations of things of the one to another desiring such and such a thing if it be absent and to move towards it unless it be hindered and to acquiess acquiesce in it when it is obtained shunning the contrary and dreading the approach of it and not resting in or being contented with it heraclitus therefore being guided by this opinion professed that all things were made by enmity & friendship now the inclinations of friendship are such in vegetables and minerals as is that attractive inclination which the loadstone hath upon iron and the emrald emerald upon riches and favour the jasper upon the birth of any thing and the stone achates upon eloquence in like manner there is a kind of bituminous clay that draws fire and leaps into it wheresoever it sees it even so doth the root of the hearb herb aproxis draw fire from afar off also the same inclination there is betwixt the male palme and female whereof when the bough of one shall touch the bough of the other they fold themselves into mutual embraces neither doth the female bring forth fruit without the male and the almond tree when she is alone is less fruitfull the vines love the elme and the olivetree and myrtle love one the other also the olivetree and fig tree now in animals there is amity betwixt the blackbird and thrush betwixt the crow and heron betwixt peacocks and pigeons turtles and parrats parrots whence sappho writes to phaon to birds unlike oftimes joyned are white doves also the bird thats green black turtle loves again the whale and the little fish his guide are friendly neither is this amity in animals amongst themselves but also with other things as with metals stones and vegetables so the cat delights in the hearb herb nip catnip by rubbing her self upon which she is said to conceive without a male and there be mares in cappadocia that expose themselves to the blast of the wind and by the attraction thereof conceive so frogs toads snakes and all manner of creeping poisonous things delight in the plant called pasflower of whom as the physitians physicians say if any one eat he shall dye die with laughing the tortoise also when he is hunted by the adder eats origanum origano and is thereby strengthened and the stork when he hath eat snakes seeks for a remedy in origanum origano and the weesell weasel when he goes to fight with the basilisk eats rue whence we come to know that origanum origano and rue are effectuall against poison so in some animals there is an imbred skil and medicinall art for when the toad is wounded with a bite or poison of another animall he is wont to go to rue or sage and rub the place wounded and so escapes the danger of the poison so men have learned many excellent remedies of diseases & vertues of things from bruits brutes so swallows have shewed us that sallendine is very medicinable for the sight with which they cure the eyes of their young and the pye when she is sick puts a bayleafe into her nest and is recovered in like maner cranes dawes jackdaws partriges partridges blackbirds purge their nauseous stomacks stomachs with the same with which also crows allay the poison of the chameleon and the lyon lion if he be feavorish feverish is recovered by eating of an ape the lapwing being surfetted surfeited with eating of grapes cures himself with southernwood so the harts have taught us that the hearb herb ditany is very good to draw out darts for they being wounded with an arrow cast it out by eating of this hearb herb the same do goats in candy so hinds a little before they bring forth purge themselves with a certain hearb herb called mountain osier also they that are hurt with spiders seek a remedy by eating of crabs swine also being hurt by snakes cure themselves by eating of them and crows when they perceive they are poisoned with a kinde of french poison seek for cure in the oake elephants when they have swallowed a chameleon help themselves with the wild olive bears being hurt with mandrakes escape the danger by eating of pismires ants geese ducks and such like watery fowle cure themselves with the hearb herb called willsage pigeons turtles hens with the hearb herb called pellitory of the wall cranes with bullrushes bulrushes leopards cure themselves being hurt with the hearb herb called wolfesbane by mans dung boars with ivy hinds with the hearb herb called cinnara chapter xviii of the inclinations of enmities on the contrary there are inclinations of emnities and they are as it were the odium and anger indignation and a certain kind of obstinate contrariety of nature so that any thing shuns its contrary and drives it away out of its presence such kinds of inclinations hath rhubarb against choller choler treacle against poison the saphir sapphire stone against hot biles boils and feavorish feverish heats and diseases of the eyes the amethyst against drunkenness the jasper against flux of blood and offensive imaginations the emrald emerald and agnus castus against lust achates against poison piony peony against the falling sickness corall against the ebullition of black choller choler and pains of the stomack stomach the topaze against spirituall heats such as are covetousness lust and all manner of excesses of love the like inclination is there also of pismire ants against the hearb herb origanum origano and the wing of a bat and the heart of a lapwing from the presence of which they flie fly also origanum origano is contrary to a certain poisonous fly which cannot endure the sun and resists salamanders and loathes cabbage with such a deadly hatred that they destroy one the other so cucumbers hate oile and will run themselves into a ring least they should touch it and it is said that the gall of a crow makes men afraid and drives them sway from where it is as also certain other things so a diamond doth disagree with the loadstone that being set by it it will not suffer iron to be drawn to it and sheep fly from frogparsley as from some deadly thing and that which is more wonderfull nature hath pictured the sign of this death in the livers of sheep in which the very figure of frogparsley being described doth naturally appear so goats do so hate garden basil as if there were nothing more pernicious and again amongst animals mice and weesels weasels do disagree whence it is said that mice will not touch cheese if the brains of a weesel weasel be put in the rennet and besides that the cheese will not be corrupt with age so a lizard is so contrary to scorpions that it makes them afraid with its very sight as also it puts them into a cold sweat therefore they are killed with the oile of them which oile also cures the wounds made by scorpions there is also an enmity betwixt scorpions and mice wherefore if a mouse be applyed to a prick or wound made by a scorpion it cures it as it is reported there is also an enmity betwixt scorpions and stalabors aspes and waspes it is reported also that nothing is so much an enemy to snakes as crabs and that if swine be hurt therewith they eat them and are cured the sun also being in cancer serpents are tormented also the scorpion and crocodile kil kill one the other and if the bird ibis doth but touch a crocodile with one of his feathers he makes him immovable the bird called bustard flies away at the sight of a horse and a hart runs away at the sight of a ram as also of a viper an elephant trembles at the hearing of the grunting of a hog so doth a lyon lion at the sight of a cock and panthers will not touch them that are annointed anointed all over with the broth of a hen especially if garlick hath been boiled in it there is also enmity betwixt foxes and swans buls bulls and daws jackdaws amongst birds also some are at a perpetuall strife one with another as also with other animals as daws jackdaws and owles the kite and crows the turtle and ringtaile egepis and eagles harts and dragons also amongst water animals there is enmity as betwixt dolphins and whirpools mullets and pikes lampreys and congers also the fish called pourcontrel makes the lobster so much afraid that the lobster seeing the other but neer him is struck dead the lobster and conger tear one the other the civet cat is said to stand so in awe of the panther that he hath no power to resist him or touch his skin and they say that if the skins of both of them be hanged up one against the other the haires of the panthers skin fall off and orus apollo saith in his hieroglyphicks if any one be girt about with the skin of the civet cat that he may pass safely through the middle of his enemies and not at all be afraid also the lamb is very much afraid of the wolf and flies from him and they say that if the taile or skin or head of a wolf be hanged upon the sheepcoate the sheep are much troubled and cannot eat their meat for fear and pliny makes mention of a bird called marlin that breaks crows eggs whose young are so annoyed by the fox that she also will pinch and pull the foxes whelps and the fox her self also which when the crows see they help the fox against her as against a common enemy the litle bird called a linnet living in thistles hates asses because they eat the flowers of thistles also there is such a bitter enmity betwixt the litle bird called esalon and the asse that their blood will not mix together and that at the braying of the asse both the eggs and young of the esalon perish there is also such a disagreement betwixt the olivetree and a harlot that if she plant it it will either be alwayes unfruitfull or altogether wither a lyon lion fears nothing so much as fired torches and will be tamed by nothing so much as by these and the wolf fears neither sword nor spear but a stone by the throwing of which a wound being made worms breed in the wolf a horse fears a camell so that he cannot endure to see so much as his picture an elephant when he rageth is quieted by seeing of a cock a snake is afraid of a man that is naked but pursues a man that is clothed a mad bull is tamed by being tyed to a figtree amber draws all things to it besides garden basill and those things which are smeared with oile betwixt which there is a kinde of a naturall antipathy chapter xix how the vertues of things are to be tryed and found out which are in them specifically or in any one individuall by way of speciall gift moreover thou must consider that the vertues of things are in some things according to the species as boldness and courage in a lyon lion & cock fearfulness in a hare or lamb ravenousness in a wolf treachery and deceitfulness in a fox flattery in a dog covetousness in a crow and daw jackdaw pride in a horse anger in a tygre tiger and boar sadness and melancholy in a cat lust in a sparrow and so of the rest for the greatest part of naturall vertues doth follow the species yet some are in things individually as there be some men which do so wonderfully abhor the sight of a cat that they cannot look upon her without quaking which fear it is manifest is not in them as they are men and avicen tels of a man that lived in his time whom all poisonous things did shun all of them dying which did by chance bite him he himself not being hurt and albertus reports that in a city of the ubians he saw a wench who would catch spiders to eat them and being much pleased with such a kind of meat was wonderfully nourished therewith so is boldness in a harlot fearfulness in a thief and upon this account it is that philosophers say that any particular thing that never was sick is good against any manner of sickness therefore they say that a bone of a dead man who never had a feavor fever being laid upon the patient frees him of his quartane there are also many singular vertues infused into particular things by celestiall bodies as we have shewed before chapter xx that naturall vertues are in some things throughout their whole substance and in other things in certain parts and members again thou must consider that the vertues of things are in some things in the whole ie the whole substance of them or in all their parts as that little fish echeneis which is said to stop a ship by its meer touch this it doth not do according to any particular part but according to the whole substance so the civet cat hath this in its whole substance that dogs by the very touch of his shadow hold their peace so salendine is good for the sight not according to any one but all its parts not more in the root then in the leaves and seeds and so of the rest but some vertues are in things according to some parts of it viz only in the tongue or eyes or some other members and parts so in the eyes of a basilisk is a most violent power to kill men assoon as they see them the like power is there in the eyes of the civet cat which makes any animall that it hath looked upon to stand still to be amazed and not able to move it self the like vertue is there in the eyes of some wolfes wolves which if they see a man first make him amazed and so hoarse that if he would cry out he hath not the use of his voice of this virgil makes mention when he sings moeris is dumb hath lost his voice and why the wolf on moeris first hath cast his eye so also there were some certain women in scythia and amongst the illyrians and triballians who as often as they looked angrily upon any man were said to slay him also we read of a certain people of rhodes called telchines who corrupted all things with their sight wherefore jupiter drowned them therefore witches when they would after this manner work by witchcraft use the eyes of such kind of animals in their waters for the eyes for the like effects in like manner do pismires ants fly from the heart of a lapwing not from the head foot or eyes so the gall of lizards being bruised in water is said to gather weesels weasels together not the taile or the head of it and the gall of goats put into the earth in a brazen vesel vessel gathers frogs together and a goats liver is an enemy to butterflies and all maggots and dogs shun them that have the heart of a dog about them and foxes will not touch those poultry that have eaten the liver of a fox so divers things have divers vertues dispersed variously through several parts as they are from above infused into them according to the diversity of things to be received as in a mans body the bones receive nothing but life the eyes sight the ears hearing and there is in mans body a certain little bone which the hebrews call lvz of the bigness of a pulse that is husked which is subject to no corruption neither is it overcome with fire but is alwaies preserved unhurt out of which as they say as a plant out of the seed our animall bodies shall in the resurrection of the dead spring up and these vertues are not cleared by reason but by experience chapter xxi of the vertues of things which are in them only in their life time and such as remain in them even after their death moreover we must know that there are some properties in things only whilest they live and some that remain after their death so the litle fish echeneis stops the ships and the basilisk and catablepa kill with their sight when they are alive but when they are dead do no such thing so they say that in the colick if a live duck be applyed to the belly it takes away the pain and her self dies like to this is that which archytas sayes if you take a heart newly taken out of an animall and whilest it is yet warm and hang it upon one that hath a quartane feavor fever it drives it away so if any one swallow the heart of a lapwing or a swallow or a weesel weasel or a mole whilest it is yet warm with naturall heat it shall be helpfull to him for remembring remembering understanding and foretelling hence is this generall rule viz that whatsoever things are taken out of animals whether they be stones any member excrements as haire dung nailes they must be taken from those animals whilest they be yet living and if it be possible that so they may be alive afterwards whence they say when you take the tongue of a frog you must put the frog into the water again and if you take the tooth of a wolf you must not kill the wolf and so of the rest so writes democritus if any one take out the tongue of a waterfrog yet living no other part of the body sticking to it and she be let go into the water again & lay it upon the place where the heart beats of a woman she shall answer truly whatsoever you ask her also they say that if the eyes of a frog be before sun rising bound to the sick party and the frog be let go again blind into the water they will drive away tertian ague as also that they will being bound with the flesh of a nightingale in the skin of a hart keep one alwaies watchfull without sleep also the ray of the fork fish being bound to the navil navel is said to make a woman have an easie travel if it be taken from it alive and it put into the sea again so they say the right eye of a serpent being applyed doth help the watering of the eyes if the serpent be let go alive and there is a certain fish or great serpent called myrus whose eye if it be pulled out and bound to the forehead of the patient is said to cure the inflamation inflammation of the eyes and that the eye of the fish grows again and that he is taken blind that did not let the fish go also the teeth of all serpents being taken out whilest they are alive and hanged about the patient are said to cure the quartane so doth the tooth of a mole taken out whilest she is alive being afterwards let go cure the toothach toothache and dogs will not bark at those that have the taile of a weesel weasel that is escaped and democritus relates that the tongue of a chameleon if it be taken from her alive doth conduce to a good success in trials and is profitable for women that are in travel if it be about the outside of the house for you must take heed that it be not brought into the house because that would be most dangerous moreover there be some properties that remain after death and of these the platonists say that they are things in which the idea of the matter is less swallowed up in these even after death that which is immortall in them doth not cease to work wonderfull things so in the hearbs herbs and plants pulled asunder and dryed that vertue is quick and operative which was infused at first into them by the idea thence it is that as the eagle all her life time doth overcome all other birds so also her feathers after her death destroy and consume the feathers of all other birds upon the same account doth a lyons lions skin destroy all other skins and the skin of the civet cat destroyes the skin of the panther and the skin of a wolf corrodes the skin of a lamb and some of these do not do it by way of a corporeall contact but also sometimes by their very sound so a drum made of the skin of a wolf makes a drum made of a lamb skin not to sound also a drum made of the skin of the fish called rotchet drives away all creeping things at what distance soever the sound of it is heard and the strings of an instrument made of the guts intestines of a wolf and being strained strung upon a harp or lute with strings made of sheeps guts will make no harmony chapter xxii how inferior things are subjected to superior bodies and how the bodies the actions and dispositions of men are ascribed to stars and signes it is manifest that all things inferiour are subject to the superiour and after a manner as saith proclus they are one in the other viz in inferiour are superiour and in superiour are inferiour so in the heaven are things terrestriall but as in their cause and in a celestiall manner and in the earth are things celestiall but after a terrestriall manner as in an effect so we say that there be here certain things which are solary and certain which are lunary in which the sun and moon make a strong impression of their vertue whence it is that these kind of things receive more operations and properties like to those of the stars & signes which they are under so we know that solary things respect the heart & head by reason that leo is the house of the sun and aries the exaltation of the sun so things under mars are good for the head and testicles by reason of aries and scorpio hence they whose senses faile and heads ake ache by reason of drunkenness if they put their testicles into cold water or wash them with vinegar find present help but in reference to these it is necessary to know how mans body is distributed to planets & signes know therefore that according to the doctrine of the arabians the sun rules over the brain heart the thigh the marrow the right eye and the spirit also the tongue the mouth and the rest of the organs of the senses as well internall as externall also the hands feet legs nerves and the power of imagination that mercury rules over the spleen stomack stomach bladder womb and right ear as also the faculty of the common sense that saturn rules over the liver and fleshy part of the stomack stomach that jupiter over the belly and navill navel whence it is written by the ancients that the effigies of a navil navel was laid up in the temple of jupiter hammon also some attribute to him the ribs breast bowels blood arms and the right hand and left ear and the powers natural and some set mars over the blood and veins the kidnies kidneys the bag of the gall gall bladder the buttocks the back motion of the sperm and the irascible power again they set venus over the kidnies kidneys the testicles the privities the womb the seed and concupiscible power as also the flesh fat belly breast navill navel and all such parts as server to venerall venereal acts also the os sacrum the back bone backbone and loins as also the head mouth with which they give a kiss as a token of love now the moon although she may challenge the whole body and every member thereof according to the variety of the signes yet more particularly they ascribe to her the brain lungs marrow of the back bone backbone the stomack stomach the menstrues and all other excrements and the left eye as also the power of increasing but hermes saith that there are seven holes in the head of an animall distributed to the seven planets viz the right ear to saturne the left to jupiter the right nostrell nostril to mars the left to venus the right eye to the sun the left to the moon and the mouth to mercury the severall signes also of the zodiack take care of their members so aries governs the head and face taurus the neck gemini the armes and shoulders cancer the breast lungs stomack stomach and armes leo heart stomack stomach liver and back virgo the bowels and bottome of the stomack stomach libra the kidnies kidneys thighs and buttocks scorpius scorpio the genitals the privities and womb sagittarius the thigh and groins capricornus the knees aquarius the legs and shins pisces the feet and as the triplicities of these signes answer one the other and agree in celestials so also they agree in the members which is sufficiently manifest by experience because with the coldness of the feet the belly and breast are affected which members answer the same triplicity whence it is if a medicine be applyed to the one it helps the other as by the warming of the feet the pain of the belly ceaseth remember therefore this order and know that things which are under any one of the planets have a certain particular aspect or inclination to those members that are attributed to that planet and especially to the houses and exaltations thereof for the rest of the dignities as those triplicities and markes and face are of litle account in this upon this account therefore piony peony balme clovegilliflowers citronpils sweet marjoram cynnamon cinnamon saffron lignum aloes frankincense amber musk and myrrh help the head and heart by reason of sol the sun aries and leo so doth ribwort the hearb herb of mars help the head and testicles by reason of aries and scorpio and so of the rest also all things under saturne conduce to sadness and melancholly melancholy those under jupiter to mirth and honour those under mars to boldness contention and anger those under the sun to glory victory and courage those under venus to love lust and concupiscence those under mercury to eloquence those under the moon to a common life also all the actions and dispositions of men are distributed according to the planets for saturne governes old men monkes melancholly melancholy men and hid treasures and those things which are obtained with long journies journeys and difficulty but jupiter those that are religious prelates kings and dukes and such kind of gains that are got lawfully mars rules over barbers chirurgeons physitians physicians sergeants executioners butchers all that make fires bakers souldiers soldiers who are every where called martial men also do the other stars signifie their office as they are described in the books of astrologers chapter xxiii how we shall know what stars naturall things are under and what things are under the sun which are called solary now it is very hard to know what star or signe every thing is under yet it is known through the imitation of their rayes or motion or figure of the superiours also some of them are known by their colours and odours also some by the effects of their operations answering to some stars so then solary things or things under the power of the sun are amongst elements the lucid flame in the humours the purer blood and spirit of life amongst tasts tastes that which is quick mixed with sweetness amongst metals gold by reason of its splendor and its receiving that from the sun which makes it cordiall and amongst stones they which resemble the rayes of the sun by their golden sparklings as doth the glittering stone aetites which hath power against the fallingsickness and poisons so also the stone which is called the eye of the sun being of a figure like to the apple of the eye from the middle whereof shines forth a ray it comforts the brain and strengthens the sight so the carbuncle which shines by night hath a vertue against all aiery and vaporous poison so the chrysolite stone is of a light green colour in which when it is held against the sun there shines forth a golden star and this comforts those parts that serve for breathing & helps those that be asthmaticall and if it be bored through and the hole filled with the mane of an asse and bound to the left arme it drives away idle imaginations and melancholy fears and puts away foolishness so the stone called iris which is like crystall in colour being often found with six corners when under some roof part of it is held against the rayes of the sun and the other part is held in the shadow it gathers the rayes of the sun into it self which whilest it sends them forth by way of reflection makes a rainbow rainbow appear on the opposite wall also the stone heliotropion heliotrope green like the jasper or emrald emerald beset with red specks ie bloodstone makes a man constant renowned and famous also it conduceth to long life and the vertue of it indeed is most wonderfull upon the beams of the sun which it is said to turn into blood ie to appear of the colour of blood as if the sun were eclypsed eclipsed viz when it is joyned to the juice of a hearb herb of the same name and be put into a vessell of water there is also another vertue of it more wonderfull and that is upon the eyes of men whose sight it doth so dim and dazel dazzle that it doth not suffer him that carries it to see it & this it doth not do without the help of the hearb herb of the same name which also is called heliotropium heliotrope ie following the sun these vertues doth albertus magnus and william of paris confirm in their writings the hyacinth also hath a vertue from the sun against poisons and pestiferous vapours it makes him that carries it to be safe and acceptable it conduceth also to riches and wit it strengthens the heart being held in the mouth it doth wonderfully cheer up the mind also there is the stone pyrophylus of a red mixture which albertus magnus saith sculapius makes mention of in one of his epistles unto octavius augustus saying that there is a certain poison so wonderfull cold which preserves the heart of man being taken out from burning so that if for any time it be put into the fire it is turned into a stone and this is that stone which is called pyrophylus from the fire it hath a wonderfull vertue against poison and it makes him that carries it to be renowned and dreadfull to his enemies but above all that stone is most solary which apollonius is reported to have found and which is called pantaura which draws other stones to it as the loadstone doth iron most powerfull against all poisons it is called by some pantherus because it is spotted like the beast called the panther it is therefore also called pantochras because it contains all colours aaron cals it evanthum there are also other solary stones as the topazius chrysopassus the rubine and balagius so also is auripigmentum and things of a golden colour and very lucid amongst plants also and trees those are solary which turn towards the sun as the marygold marigold and those which fold in their leaves when the sun is neer upon setting but when it riseth unfold their leaves by little and little the lotetree also is solary as is manifest by the figure of the fruit & leaves so also piony peony sallendine balme ginger gentian dittany & vervin vervain which is of use in prophecying prophesying and expiations as also driving away evill spirits the baytree also is consecrated to phoebus so is the cedar the palm tree the ash the ivie ivy and vine and whatsoever repell poisons and lightnings and those things which never fear the extremities of the winter solary also are mint mastick zedoary saffron balsome balsam amber musk yellow honey lignum aloes cloves cinnamon calamus aromaticus pepper frankincense sweet marjoram also libanotis which orpheus cals the sweet perfume of the sun amongst animals those are solary which are magnanimous couragious courageous ambitious of victory and renown as the lyon lion king of beasts the crocodile the spotted wolf the ram the boar the bull king of the herd which was by the egyptians at heliopolis dedicated to the sun which they called verites and an ox was consecrated to apis in memphi memphis and in herminthus a bull by the name of pathis the wolf also was consecrated to apollo and latona also the beast called baboon is solary which twelve times in a day viz every hour barks and in time of equinoctium equinox pisseth urinates twelve times every hour the same also it doth in the night whence the egyptians did engrave him upon their fountains also amongst birds these are solary the phoenix being but one of that kind and the eagle the queen of birds also the vulture the swan and those which sing at the rising sun and as it were call upon it to rise as the cock crow also the hawk which because it in the divinity of the egyptians is an emblem of the spirit and light is by porphyrius porphyry reckoned amongst the solary birds moreover all such things as have some resemblance of the works of the sun as worms shining in the night and the betle beetle which is a creature that lies under cowdung also according to appious interpretation such whose eyes are changed according to the course of the sun are accounted solary and those things which come of them and amongst fish the sea calf is chiefly solary who doth resist lightning also shell fish and the fish called pulmo both which shine in the night and the fish called stella ie starfish for his parching heat and the fish called strombi ie strombite or seasnail that follow their king and margari ie oyster which also have a king and being dryed are hardened into a stone of a golden colour chapter xxiv what things are lunary or under the power of the moon these things are lunary amongst the elements viz the earth then the water as well that of the sea as of the rivers and all moist things as the moisture of trees and animals especially they which are white as the whites of eggs fat sweat flegme phlegm and the superfluities of bodies amongst tasts tastes salt and insipid amongst metals silver amongst stones crystall the silver marcasite and all those stones that are white and green also the stone selenites ie lunary shining from a white body with a yellow brightness imitating the motion of the moon having in it the figure of the moon which daily increaseth or decreaseth as doth the moon also pearls which are generated in shels shells of fishes from the droppings of water also the berill beryl amongst plants and trees these are lunary as the selenotropion which turns towards the moon as doth the heliotropion towards the sun and the palme tree sends forth a bough at every rising of the moon hyssope also and rosemary agnus castu and the olivetree are lunary also the hearb herb chinosta which increaseth and decreaseth with the moon viz in substance and number of leaves not only in sap and vertue which indeed is in some sort common to all plants except onions which are under the influence of mars which have contrary properties as amongst flying things the saturnine bird called a quaile is a great enemy to the moon and sun lunary animals are such as delight to be in mans company and such as do naturally excell in love or hatred as all kinds of dogs the chameleon also is lunary which alwaies assumes a colour according to the variety of the colour of the object as the moon changeth her nature according to the variety of the signe which it is found in lunary also are swine hinds goats and all animals whatsoever that observe and imitate the motion of the moon as the baboon and panther which is said to have a spot upon her shoulder like the moon increasing into a roundness and having horns that bend inwards cats also are lunary whose eyes become greater or less according to the course of the moon and those things which are of like nature as menstruous blood of which are made wonderfull and strange things by magicians the civetcat also changing her sex being obnoxious to divers sorceries and all animals that live in water as well as on land as otters and such as prey upon fish also all monstrous beasts such as without any manifest seed are equivocally generated as mice which sometimes are generated by coition sometimes of the putrefaction of the earth amongst fowle geese ducks didoppers and all kind of watery fowl as prey upon fish as the heron and those that are equivocally produced as wasps of the carkases carcasses of horses bees of the putrefaction of cows small flies of putrefied wine and betles beetles of the flesh of asses but most lunary of all is the twohorned betle beetle horned after the manner of a bull which digs under cowdung and there remaines for the space of twenty eight daies in which time the moon measures the whole zodiack and in the twenty ninth day when it thinks there will be a conjunction of their brightness it opens the dung and casts it into water from whence then come betles beetles amongst fish these are lunary lurus whose eyes are changed according to the course of the moon and whatsoever observes the motion of the moon as the tortoise the echeneis crabs oisters oysters cockles and frogs chapter xxv what things are saturnine or under the power of saturne saturnine things amongst elements are earth and also water amongst humors black choller choler that is moist as well natural as adventitious adust choller choler excepted amongst tasts tastes soure tart and dead amongst metals lead and gold by reason of its weight and the golden marcasite amongst stones the onix onyx the ziazaa the camonius the saphir sapphire the brown jasper the chalcedon the loadstone and all dark weighty earthy things amongst plants and trees the daffodill dragonwort dragons wort rue cummin cumin hellebor hellebore the tree from whence benzoine comes mandrake opium and those things which stupifie and those things which are never sown and never bear fruit and those which bring forth berries of a dark colour and black fruit as the black figtree the pinetree the cypresstree and a certain tree used at burials which never springs afresh with berries rough of a bitter tast taste of a strong smell of a black shadow yielding a most sharp pitch bearing a most unprofitable fruit never dies with age deadly dedicated to pluto as is the hearb herb pasflower with which they were wont anciently to strow the graves before they put the dead bodies into them wherefore it was lawfull to make their garlands at feasts with all hearbs herbs and flowers besides pasflowers because it was mournfull and not conducing to mirth also all creeping animals living apart and solitary nightly sad contemplative dull covetous fearfull melancholly melancholy that take much pains slow that feed grosly and such as eat their young of these kinds therefore are the ape the cat the hog the mule the camel the bear the mole the asses the wolf the hare the dragon the basilisk the toad all serpents and creeping things scorpions pismires ants and such things as proceed from putrefaction in the earth in water or in the ruines of houses as mice and many sorts of vermin amongst birds those are saturnine which have long necks and harsh voices as cranes estriches ostriches and peacocks which are dedicated to saturn and juno also the scrichowle screechowl the hornowle hornedowl the bat the lapwing the crow the quaile which is the most envious bird of all amongst fishes the eel living apart from all other fish the lamprey the dogfish which devours her young also the tortoise oisters oysters cockles to which may be added seaspunges seasponges and all such things as come of them chapter xxvi what things are under the power of jupiter and are called jovial things under jupiter amongst elements are the aire amongst humors blood and the spirit of life also all things which respect the encrease increase nourishment and vegetation of the life amongst tasts tastes such as are sweet and pleasant amongst metals tin silver and gold by reason of their temperateness amongst stones the hyacinth beril beryl saphir sapphire tutia the emrald emerald green jasper and permanently green and copper coloured aiery colours amongst plants and trees seagreen garden basil bugloss mace spike mints mastick elicampane the violet darnell henbane the poplar tree and those which are called lucky trees as the oke oak the tree sculus horsechestnut which is like an oke oak but much bigger the holm tree the beech tree the hasle hazel tree the service tree the white fig tree the pear tree the apple tree the vine the plum tree the ash the dogtree and the olive tree and also oile oil oleum also all manner of corn as barley wheat also raisins licorish licorice sugar and all such things whose sweetness is manifest and subtile partaking somewhat of an astringent and sharp tast taste as are nuts almonds pineapples pineapples filberds filberts pistake nuts pistachios roots of peony mirabolaus rhubarb and manna orpheus adds storax amongst animals such as have some stateliness and wisdom in them and those which are mild well trained up and of good dispositions as the hart and elephant and those which are gentle as sheep and lambs amongst birds those that are of a temperate complexion as hens together with the yolk of their eggs also the partridge the pheasant the swallow the pellican pelican the cuckow cuckoo the stork birds given to a kind of devotion which are emblemes of gratitude the eagle is dedicated to jupiter she is the ensigne of emperours and an embleme of justice and clemency amongst fish the dolphin the fish called anchia anchovy the sheath fish by reason of his devoutness tutia lat tuthia is omitted in the jf english translation jhp lat et perpetuo virides aereique colores jhp chapter xxvii what things are under the power of mars and are called martial these things are martiall amongst elements fire together with all adust and sharp things amongst humours choller choler also bitter tasts tastes tart and burning the tongue and causing tears amongst metals iron and red brass and all fiery red and sulphureous things amongst stones the diamond loadstone the bloodstone bloodstone the jasper the stone that consists of divers kinds and the amethist amethyst amongst plants and trees hellebor garlick euphorbium cartabana armoniack radish the laurell wolfsbane wolfsbane scammony and all such as are poysonous poisonous by reason of too much heat and those which are beset round about with prickles or by touching the skin burn it prick it or make it swell as cardis the nettle crowfoot and such as being eaten cause tears as onyons onions ascolonia leeks mustardseed and all thorny trees and the dogtree dogwood which is dedicated to mars and all such animals as are warlike ravenous bold and of clear fancy as the horse mule goat kid wolf libard leopard the wild ass serpents also and dragons full of displeasure and poyson poison also all such as are offensive to men as gnats flies baboon by reason of his anger all birds that are ravenous devour flesh break bones as the eagle the faulcon falcon the hawk the vultur vulture and those which are called the fatall birds as the hornowl the scrichowl screechowl castrels kites and such as are hungry and ravenous and such as make a noise in their swallowing as crows ravens daws crows the pie woodpeckers which above all the rest is dedicated to mars and amongst fishes the pike the barbell the forkfish the fish that hath horns like a ram the sturgeon the glacus all which are great devourers and ravenous iaspis multigenius all thorny trees and the dogtree omnes spinosae atque cornus lat ferales funereal lat corvi et cornices et picus chapter xxviii what things are under the power of venus and are called venereall these things are under venus amongst elements aire and water amongst humours flegm phlegm with blood spirit and seed amongst tasts tastes those which are sweet unctuous and delectable amongst metals silver and brass both yellow and red amongst stones the berill beryl chrysolite emrald emerald saphir sapphire green jasper corneola carnelian the stone aetites the lazull lazuli stone corall and all of a fair various white and green colour amongst plants and trees the vervin vervain violet maidenhaire valerian which by the arabian is called phu also thyme the gum ladanum ambergrise amber musk sanders sandalwood coriander and all sweet perfumes and delightfull and sweet fruits as sweet pears figs pomegranats pomegranates which the poets say was in cyprus first sown by venus also the rose of lucifer was dedicated to her also the myrtle tree of hesperus moreover all luxurious delicious animals and of a strong love as dogs conies stinking sheep and goats both female and male which generates sooner then any other animall for they say that he couples after the seventh day of his being brought forth also the bull for his disdain and the calf for his wantonness amongst birds the swan the wagtail the swallow the pellican pelican the burgander which are very loving to their yong young also the crow and pigeon which is dedicated to venus and the turtle turtledove one whereof was commanded to be offered at the purification after bringing forth the sparrow also was dedicated to venus which was commanded in the law to be used in the purification after the leprosie leprosy a martiall disease then which nothing was of more force to resist it also the egyptians called the eagle venus because she is prone to venery for after she hath been trod thirteen times a day if the male call her she runs to him again

moves all things indistinctly amongst humors those especially which are mixed as also the animall spirit amongst tasts tastes those that are various strange and mixed amongst metals quicksilver tin the slver marcasite amongst stones the emrald emerald achates agates red marble topaze and those which are of divers colours and various figures naturally & those that are artificiall as glass & those which have a colour mixed with yellow and green amongst plants and trees the hazle hazel fiveleavedgrass the hearb herb mercury fumitary pimpernell marjoram parsly parsley and such as have shorter and

amongst fish the fish called trochius which goes into himself also pourcontrell for deceitfulness and changeableness and the fork fish for its industry the mullet also that shakes off the bait on the hook with his taile chapter xxx that the whole sublunary world and those things which are in it are distributed to planets moreover whatsoever is found in the whole world is made according to the governments of the planets and accordingly receives its vertue so in fire the enlivening light thereof is under the government of the sun the heat of it under mars in the earth the various superficies thereof under the moon and mercury and the starry heaven the whole mass of it under saturne but in the middle elements aire is under jupiter and water the moon but being mixed are under mercury and venus in like manner naturall active causes observe the sun the matter the moon the fruitfulness of active causes jupiter the fruitfullness of the matter venus the sudden effecting of any thing mars and mercury that for his vehemency this for his dexterity and manifold vertue but the permanent continuation of all things is ascribed to saturne also amongst vegetables every thing that bears fruit is from jupiter and every thing that bears flowers is from venus all seed and bark is from mercury and all roots from saturne and all wood from mars and leaves from the moon wherefore all that bring forth fruit and not flowers are of saturne and jupiter but they that bring forth flowers and seed and not fruit are of venus and mercury these which are brought forth of their own accord without seed are of the moon and saturn all beauty is from venus all strength from mars and every planet rules and disposeth that which is like to it also in stones their weight clamminess and sliptickness is of saturne their use and temperament of jupiter their hardness from mars their life from the sun their beauty and fairness from venus their occult vertue from mercury and their common use from the moon chapter xxxi how provinces and kingdomes are distributed to planets moreover the whole orb of the earth is distributed by kingdoms and provinces to the planets and signes for macedonia thracia illyria arriana gordiana many of which countries are in the lesser asia are under saturne with capricorn but with aquarius under him are the sauromatian country oxiana sogdiana arabia phazania media and thiopia ethiopia which countries for the most part belong to the more inward asia under jupiter with sagittarius are tuscana celtica spaine and happy arabia under him with pisces are lycia lydia cilicia pamphylia paphlagonia nasamonia and lybia mars with aries governs britany france germany bastarnia the lower parts of syria idumea and judea with scorpio he rules syria comagena cappadocia metagonium mauritania and getulia the sun with leo governs italy apulia sicilia phenicia chaldea & the orchenians venus with taurus governs the isles cyclades the seas of litle asia cyprus parthia media persia but with libra she commands the people of the island bractia of caspia of seres of thebais of oasis and of troglodys mercury with gemini rules hircania armenia mantiana cyrenaica marmarica and the lower egypt but with virgo greece achaia creta babylon mesopotamia assyria and ela whence they of that place are in scripture called elamites the moon with cancer governs bithivia phrygia colchica numidia africa carthage and all carchedonia these we have in this manner gathered from ptolemies ptolomys opinion to which according to the writings of other astrologers many more may be added but he which knows how to compare these divisions of provinces according to the divisions of the stars with the ministery ministry of the ruling intelligencies and blessings of the tribes of israel the lots of the apostles and typicall seales of the sacred scripture shall be able to obtain great and propheticall oracles concerning every region of things to come ptolemy quadripartitum cf ed f boll ae boer leipzig aka tetrabiblos compare tr ashmand jhp chapter xxxii what things are under the signes the fixed stars and their images the like consideration is to be had in all things concerning the figures of the fixed stars so they will have the terrestiall terrestrial ram to be under the rule of the celestiall aries and the terrestiall bull and ox to be under the celestiall taurus so also that cancer should rule over crabs and leo over lyons lions virgo over virgins and scorpio over scorpions capricorn over goats sagittarius over horses and pisces over fishes also the celestiall ursa over bears hydra over serpents and the dogstar over dogs and so of the rest now apuleius distributes certain and peculiar hearbs herbs to the signes and planets viz to aries the hearb herb sange sage to taurus vervine vervain that growes straight to gemini vervine vervain that growes bending to cancer comfrey to leo sowbread to virgo calamint to libra mugwort to scorpio scorpiongrass to sagittarius pimpernell to capricorn the dock to aquarius dragonwort dragonswort to pisces hartwort and to the planets these viz to saturne sengreen to jupiter agrimony to mars sulphurwort to the sun marygold marigold to venus woundwort to mercury mulleine to the moon peony but hermes whom albertus follows distributes to the planets these viz to saturne the daffodill to jupiter henbane to mars ribwort to the sun knotgrass to venus vervine vervain to mercury cinquefoile to the moon goosfoot we also know by experience that asparagus is under aries and gardenbasill under scorpio for of the shavings of ramshorn sowed comes forth asparagus and garden basill rubbed betwixt two stones produceth scorpions moreover i will according to the doctrine of hermes and thebit reckon up some of the more eminent stars whereof the first is called the head of algol and amongst stones rules over the diamond amongst plants black hellebor and mugwort the second are the pleiades or seven stars which amongst stones rule over crystall and the stone diodocus amongst plants the hearb herb diacedon and frankincense and fennill fennel and amongst metals quicksilver quicksilver the third is the star aldeboran which hath under it amongst stones the carbuncle and ruby amongst plants the milky thistle and matrysilva the fourth is called the goatstar which rules amongst stones the saphir sapphire amongst plants horehound mint mugwort and mandrake the fifth is called the great dogstar which amongst stones rules over the berill beryl amongst plants savin mugwort and dragonwort and amongst animals the tongue of a snake the sixth is called the lesser dogstar and amongst stones rules over achates agates amongst plants the flowers of marigold and penyroial pennyroyal the seventh is called the heart of the lyon which amongst stones rules over the granate amongst plants sallendine mugwort and mastick the eighth is the taile of the lesser bear which amongst stones rules over the loadstone amongst hearbs herbs succory whose leaves and flowers turn towards the north also mugwort and the flowers of perwinckle periwinkle and amongst animals the tooth of a wolf the ninth is called the wing of the crow under which amongst stones are such stones as are of the colour of the black onyx stone amongst plants the bur quadraginus henbane and comfrey and amongst animals the tongue of a frog the tenth is called spica which hath under it amongst stones the emrald emerald amongst plants sage trifoile perwinkle periwinkle mugwort and mandrake the eleventh is called alchamech which amongst stones rules over the jasper amongst plants the plantain the twelfth is called elpheia under this amongst stones is the topaze amongst plants rosemary trifoile and ivy the thirteenth is called the heart of the scorpion under which amongst stones is the sardonius and amethist amethyst amongst plants long aristolochy and saffron the fourteenth is the falling vultur under which amongst stones is the chrysolite amongst plants succory and fumitary the fifteenth is the taile of capricorn under which amongst stones is the chalcedone chalcedony amongst plants majoram marjoram mugwort and nip catnip and the root of mandrake moreover this we must know that every stone or plant or animall or any other thing is not governed by one star alone but many of them receive influence not separated but conjoyned from many stars so amongst stones the chalcedony is under saturne and mercury together with the taile of scorpion and capricorn the saphir sapphire under jupiter saturne and the star alhajoth tutia is under jupiter and the sun and moon the emrald emerald under jupiter venus and mercury and the star spica the amethyst as saith hermes is under mars jupiter and the heart of the scorpion the jasper which is of divers kinds is under mars jupiter and the star alchamech the chrysolite is under the sun venus and mercury as also under the star which is called the falling vultur the topaze under the sun and the star elpheia the diamond under mars and the head of algol in like manner amongst vegetables the hearb herb dragon is under saturne and the celestiall dragon mastick and mints are under jupiter and the sun but mastick is also under the heart of the lyon and mint under the goat star hellebor is dedicated to mars and the head of algol mosse and sanders to the sun and venus coriander to venus and saturne amongst animals the sea calf is under the sun and jupiter the fox and ape under saturne and mercury and domesticall dogs under mercury and the moon and thus we have shewed more things in these inferiours by their superiours chapter xxxiii of the seals and characters of naturall things all stars have their peculiar natures properties and conditions the seals and characters whereof they produce through their rayes even in these inferiour things viz in elements in stones in plants in animals and their members whence every thing receives from an harmonious disposition and from its star shining upon it some particular seal or character stampt upon it which is the significator of that star or harmony conteining in it a peculiar vertue differing from other vertues of the same matter both generically specifically and numerically every thing therefore hath its character pressed upon it by its star for some particular effect especially by that star which doth principally govern it and these characters contain and retain in them the peculiar natures vertues and roots of their stars and produce the like operations upon other things on which they are reflected and stir up and help the influencies of their stars whether they be planets or fixed stars and figures and celestiall signs viz as oft as they shall be made in a fit matter and in their due and accustomed times which ancient wise men considering such as laboured much in the finding out of the occult properties of things did set down in writing the images of the stars their figures seals marks characters such as nature her self did describe by the rayes of the stars in these inferiour bodies some in stones some in plants and joynts and knots of boughs and some in divers members of animals for the baytree the lotetree and the marygold marigold are solary plants and in their roots and knots being cut off shew the characters of the sun so also in the bone and shoulderblades in animals whence there arose a spatulary kind of divining ie by the shoulderblades and in stones and stony things the characters and images of celestiall things are often found but seeing that in so great a diversity of things there is not a traditionall knowledge only in a few things which humane understanding is able to reach therefore leaving those things which are to be found out in plants and stones and other things as also in the members of divers animals we shall limit our selves to mans nature only which seeing it is the compleatest image of the whole universe containing in it self the whole heavenly harmony will without all doubt abundantly afford us the seals and characters of all the stars and celestiall influencies and those as the more efficacious which are less differing from the celestiall nature but as the number of the stars is known to god alone so also their effects and seals upon these inferiour things wherefore no humane intellect is able to attain to the knowledge of them whence very few of those things became known to us which the ancient philosophers & chyromancers chiromancers attained to partly by reason and partly by experience and there be many things yet ly hid in the treasury of nture we shall here in this place note some few sealsand characters of the planets such as the ancient chyromancers chiromancers knew in the hands of men these doth julian call sacred and divine letters seeing that by them according to the holy scripture is the life of men writ in their hands and there are in all nations and languages alwaies the same and like to them and permanent to which were added and found out afterwards many more as by the ancient so by latter chyromancers chiromancers and they that would know them must have recourse to their volumes it is sufficient here to shew from whence the characters of nature have their originall and in what things they are to be enquired after there follow the figures of divine letters the letters or characters of saturne figure the letters or characters of jupiter figure the letters or characters of mars figure for these drawings i have relied on the kln cologne latin edition in the edition of gregory moule moule london the divine letters of jupiter are reversed from that in the edition in both abognazar and the magical calendar the divine letters of jupiter are also reversed from those in the edition agrippas possible source for these is bartholomeus cocles chyromantie ac phisionomie anastasis bononie jhp the letters or characters of the sun figure the letters or characters of venus figure the letters or characters of mercury figure the letters or characters of the moon figure chapter xxxiv how by naturall things and their vertues we may draw forth and attract the influencies and vertues of celestiall bodies now if thou desirest to receive vertue from any part of the world or from any star thou shalt those things being used which belong to this star come under its peculiar influence as wood is fit to receive flame by reason of sulphur pitch and oile nevertheless when thou dost to any one species of things or individual rightly apply many things which are things of the same subject scattered amongst themselves conformable to the same idea and star presently by this matter so opportunely fitted a singular gift is infused by the idea by means of the soul of the world i say opportunely fitted viz under a harmony like to the harmony which did infuse a certain vertue into the matter for although things have some vertues such as we speak of yet those vertues do so ly lie hid that there is seldom any effect produced by them but as in a grain of mustardseed bruised the sharpness which lay hid is stirred up and as the heat of the fire doth make letters apparently seen which before could not be read that were writ with the juice of an onion or milk and letters wrote upon a stone with the fat of a goat and altogether unperceived when the stone is put into vinegar appear and shew themselves and as a blow with a stick stirs up the madness of a dog which before lay asleep so doth the celestiall harmony disclose vertues lying in the water stirs them up strengtheneth them and makes them manifest and as i may so say produceth that into act which before was only in power when things are rightly exposed to it in a celestiall season as for example if thou dost desire to attract vertue from the sun and to seek those things that are solary amongst vegetables plants metals stones and animals these things are to be used and taken chiefly which in a solary order are higher for these are more available so thou shalt draw a singular gift from the sun through the beams thereof being seasonably received together and through the spirit of the world chapter xxxv of the mixtions of naturall things one with another and their benefits it is most evident that in the inferiour nature all the powers of superior bodies are not found comprehended in any one thing but are dispersed through many kinds of things amongst us as there are many solary things whereof every one doth not contain all the vertues of the sun but some have some properties from the sun and others othersome wherefore it is sometimes necessary that there be mixtions in operations that if a hundred or a thousand vertues of the sun were dispersed through so many plants animals & the like we may gather all these together and bring them into one form in which we shall see all the said vertues being united contained now there is a twofold vertue in commixtion one viz which was first planted in its parts and is celestiall the other is obtained by a certain and artificiall mixtion of things mixt amongst themselves and of the mixtions of them according to certain proportions such as agree with the heaven under a certain constellation and this vertue descends by a certain likeness and aptness that is in things amongst themselves towards their superiours and just as much as the following do by degrees correspond with them that go before where the patient is fitly applyed to its agent so from a certain composition of hearbs herbs vapours and such like made according to naturall philosophy and astronomy there results a certain common form endowed with many gifts of the stars as in the honey of bees that which is gathered out of the juice of innumerable flowers and brought into one form contains the vertue of all by a kind of divine and admirable art of the bees yet this is not to be less wondred at which eudoxus giudius reports of an artificiall kind of honey which a certain nation of gyants giants in lybia knew how to make out of flowers and that very good and not far inferiour to that of the bees for every mixtion which consists of many severall things is then most perfect when it is so firmly compacted in all parts that it becomes one is every where firm to it self and can hardly be dissipated as we sometimes see stones and divers bodies to be by a certain naturall power conglutinated and united that they seem to be wholly one thing as we see two trees by grafting to become one also oisters oysters with stones by a certain occult vertue of nature and there have been seen some animals which have been turned into stones and so united with the substance of the stone that they seem to make one body and that also homogeneous so the tree ebeny ebony is one while wood and another while stone when therefore any one makes a mixtion of many matters under the celestiall influencies then the variety of celestiall actions on the one hand and of naturall powers on the other hand being joyned together doth indeed cause wonderfull thing by ointments by collyries by fumes and such like which viz are read in the book of chiramis archyta democritus and hermes who is named alchorat and of many others chapter xxxvi of the union of mixt things and the introduction of a more noble form and the senses of life moreover we must know that by how much the more noble the form of any thing is by so much the more prone and apt it is to receive and powerfull to act then the vertues of things do then become wonderfull viz when they are put to matters that are mixed and prepared in fit seasons to make them alive by procuring life for them from the stars as also a sensible soul as a more noble form for there is so great a power in prepared matters which we see do then receive life when a perfect mixtion of qualities seems to break the former contrariety for so much the more perfect life things receive by how much their temper is more remote from contrariety now the heaven as a prevalent cause doth from the beginning of every thing to be generated by the concoction and perfect digestion of the matter together with life bestows celestiall influences and wonderfull gifts according to the capacity that is in that life and sensible soul to receive more noble and sublime vertues for the celestiall vertue doth otherwise lye asleep as sulphur kept from flame but in living bodies it doth alwaies burn as kindled sulphur then by its vapour it fils all the places that are next to it so certain wonderfull works are wrought such as are read of in the book of nemith which is tituled a book of the laws of pluto because such kind of monstrous generations are not produced according to the laws of nature for we know that of worms are generated gnats of a horse waspes of a calf and ox bees of a crab his legs being taken of off and he buried in the ground a scorpion of a duck dryed into powder and put into water are generated frogs but if it be baked in a pie and cut into pieces and put into a moist place under the ground toads are generated of it of the hearb herb garden basill bruised betwixt two stones are generated scorpions and of the hairs of a menstrous woman put under dung are bred serpents and the hair of a horse taile put into water receiveth life and is turned into a pernicious worm and there is an art wherewith by a hen sitting upon eggs may be generated a form like to a man which i have seen & know how to make which magicians say hath in it wonderfull vertues and this they call the true mandrake you must therefore know which and what kind of matters are either of nature or art begun or perfected or compounded of more things and what celestiall influencies they are able to receive for a congruity of naturall things is sufficient for the receiving of influence from celestiall because when nothing doth hinder the celestials to send forth their lights upon inferiours they suffer no matter to be destitute of their vertue wherefore as much matter as is perfect and pure is not unfit to receive the celestiall influence for that is the binding and continuity of the matter to the soul of the world which doth so daily flow in upon things naturall and all things which nature hath prepared that it is impossible that a prepared matter should not receive life or a more noble form chapter xxxvii how by some certain naturall and artificiall preparations we may attract certain celestiall and vitall gifts platonists together with hermes say and jarchus brachmanus and the mecubals of the hebrews confess that all sublunary things are subject to generation and corruption and that also there are the same things in the celestiall world but after a celestiall manner as also in the intellectuall world but in a far more perfect and better fashion and manner but in the most perfect manner of all in the exemplary and after this course that every inferiour thing should in its kind answer its superiour and through this the supream supreme it self and receive from heaven that celestiall power they call the quintessence or the spirit of the world or the middle nature and from the intellectuall world a spirituall and enlivening vertue transcending all qualities whatsoever and lastly from the exemplary or originall world through the mediation of the other according to their degree receive the originall power of the whole perfection hence every thing may be aptly reduced from these inferiours to the stars from the stars to their intelligencies and from thence to the first cause it self from the series and order whereof whole magick and all occult philosophy flowes for every day some naturall thing is drawn by art and some divine thing is drawn by nature which the egyptians seeing called nature a magicianess ie the very magicall power it self in the attracting of like by like and of sutable things by sutable now such kind of attractions by the mutuall correspondency of things amongst themselves of superiours with inferiours the grecians called sumpaqian sympathies so the earth agrees with cold water the water with moist aire the aire with fire the fire with the heaven in water neither is fire mixed with water but by aire nor the aire with the earth but by water so neither is the soul united to the body but by the spirit nor the understanding to the spirit but by the soul so we see that when nature hath framed the body of an infant by this very preparative she presently fetcheth the spirit from the universe this spirit is the instrument to obtain of god the understanding and mind in the soul and body as in wood the dryness is fitted to receive oile and the oile being imbibed is food for the fire the fire is the vehiculum of light by these examples you see how by some certain naturall and artificiall preparations we are in a capacity to receive certain celestiall gifts from above for stones and metals have a correspondency with hearbs herbs hearbs herbs with animals animals with the heavens the heavens with intelligencies and those with divine properties and attributes and with god himself after whose image and likness all things are created now the first image of god is the world of the world man of man beasts of beasts the zeophyton ie half animall and half plant of zeophyton plants of plants metals of metals stones and again in things spirituall the plant agrees with a bruit brute in vegetation a bruit brute with a man in sense man with an angel in understanding an angell with god in immortality divinity is annexed to the mind the mind to the intellect the intellect to the intention the intention to the imagination the imagination to the senses the senses at last to things for this is the band and continuity of nature that all superior vertue doth flow through every inferiour with a long and continued series dispersing its rayes even to the very last things and inferiours through their superiours come to the very supream supreme of all for so inferiours are successively joyned to their superiours that there proceeds an influence from their head the first cause as a certain string stretched out to the lowermost things of all of which string if one end be touched the whole doth presently shake and such a touch doth sound to the other end and at the motion of the inferiour the superiour also is moved to which the other doth answer as strings in a lute well tuned chapter xxxviii how we may draw not only celestiall and vitall but also certain intellectuall and divine gifts from above magicians teach that celestial gifts may through inferiors being conformable to superiors be drawn down by opportune influencies of the heaven and so also by these celestial gifts the celestial angels as they are servants of the stars may be procured and conveyed to us iamblichus proclus and synesius with the whole school of platonists confirm that not only celestiall and vitall but also certain intellectuall angelicall and divine gifts may be received from above by some certain matters having a naturall power of divinity ie which have a naturall correspondency with the superiors being rightly received and opportunely gathered together according to the rules of naturall philosophy and astronomy and mercurius trismegistus writes that an image rightly made of certain proper things appropriated to any one certain angel will presently be animated by that angel of the same also austin st augustine makes mention in his eighth book de civitate dei the city of god for this is the harmony of the world that things supercelestiall be drawn down by the celestiall and the supernaturall supernatural by naturall because there is one operative vertue that is diffused through all kinds of things by which vertue indeed as manifest things are produced out of occult causes so a magician doth make use of things manifest to draw forth things that are occult viz through the rays of the stars through fumes lights sounds and naturall things which are agreeable to celestiall in which besides corporeall qualities there is a kind of reason sense and harmony and incorporeall and divine measures and orders so we read that the ancients were wont often to receive some divine and wonderfull thing by certain naturall things so the stone that is bred in the apple of the eye of a civet cat held under the tongue of a man is said to make him to divine or prophesie prophesy the same is selenite the moon stone moonstone reported to do so they say that the images of gods may be called up by the stone called anchitis and that the ghosts of the dead may be being called up kept up by the stone synochitis the like doth the hearb herb aglauphotis do which is called marmorites growing upon the marbles of arabia as saith pliny and the which magicians use also there is an hearb herb called rheangelida which magicians drinking of can prophesie prophesy moreover there are some hearbs herbs by which the dead are raised to life whence xanthus the historian tels that with a certain hearb herb called balus a young dragon being killed was made alive again also that by the same a certain man of tillum whom a dragon killed was restored to life and juba reports that in arabia a certain man was by a certain hearb herb restored to life but whether or no any such things can be done indeed upon man by the vertue of hearbs herbs or any other naturall thing we shall discourse in the following chapter now it is certain and manifest that such things can be done upon other animals so if flies that are drowned be put into warm ashes they revive and bees being drowned do in like manner recover life in the juice of the hearb nip herb catnip and eels being dead for want of water if with their whole bodies they be put under mud in vineger vinegar and the blood of a vultur vulture being put to them will all of them in a few dayes recover life they say that if the fish echeneis be cut into peices pieces and cast into the sea the parts will within a little time come together and live also we know that the pellican pelican doth restore her yong young to life being killed with her own blood chap xxxix that we may by some certain matters of the world stir up the gods of the world and their ministring spirits no man is ignorant that evill spirits by evill and prophane profane arts may be raised up as psellus saith sorcerers are wont to do whom most detestable and abominable filthiness did follow and accompany such as were in times past in the sacrifices of priapus and in the worship of the idoll which was called panor to whom they did sacrifice with their privy members genitals uncovered neither to these is that unlike if it be true and not a fable which is read concerning the detestable heresy of old churchmen and like to these are manifest in witches and mischeivous mischievous women which wickednesses the foolish dotage of women is subject to fall into by these and such as these evill spirits are raised as a wicked spirit spake once to iohn john of one cynops a sorcerer all the power saith he of satan dwells there and he is entred into a confederacy with all the principalities together and likewise we with him and cynops obeys us and we again obey him again on the contrary side no man is ignorant that supercelestiall angels or spirits may be gained by us through good works a pure mind secret prayers devout humiliation and the like let no man therefore doubt that in like manner by some certain matters of the world the gods of the world may be raised by us or at least the ministring spirits or servants of these gods and as mercurius hermes trismegistus saith the airy spirits not supercelestiall much less higher so we read that the antient ancient priests made statues and images foretelling things to come and infused into them the spirits of the stars which were not kept there by constraint in some certain matters but rejoycing rejoiced in them viz as acknowledging such kinds of matter to be sutable suitable to them they do alwaies and willingly abide in them and speak and do wonderfull things by them no otherwise then evill spirits are wont to do when they possess mens bodies chap xl of bindings what sort they are of and in what wayes they are wont to be done wee have spoken concerning the vertues and wonderfull efficacy of naturall things it remains now that we understand a thing of great wonderment and it is a binding of men into love or hatred sickness or health and such like also the binding of thieves and robbers that they cannot steale in any place the binding of merchants that they cannot buy or sell in any place the binding of an army that they cannot pass over any bound the binding of ships that no winds though never so strong shall be able to carry them out of the haven also the binding of a mill that it can by no force whatsoever be turned round the binding of a cisterne or fountain that the water cannot be drawn up out of them the binding of the ground that it cannot bring forth fruit the binding of any place that nothing can be built upon it the binding of fire that though it be never so strong can burn no combustible thing that is put to it also the bindings of lightnings and tempests that they shall do no hurt the binding of dogs that they cannot bark also the binding of birds and wild beasts that they shall not be able to fly or run away and such like as these which are scarce credible yet often known by experience now there are such kind of bindings as these made by sorceries collyries unguents love potions by binding to and hanging up of things by rings by charmes by strong imaginations and passions by images and characters by inchantments enchantments and imprecations by lights by sound by numbers by words and names invocations sacrifices by swearing conjuring consecrations devotions and by divers superstitions and observations and such like chap xli of sorceries and their power the force of sorceries is reported to be so great that they are believed to be able to subvert consume and change all inferiour things according virgils muse moeris for me these hearbs herbs in pontus chose and curious drugs for there great plenty grows i many times with these have moeris spide spied changd to a wolfe and in the woods to hide from sepulchres would souls departed charm and corn bear standing from anothers farm also in an other place concerning the companions of ulysses whom the cruell goddess circe there invests with fierce aspects and changd to savage beasts and a litle after when love from picus circe could not gaine him with her charming wand and hellish bane changd to a bird and spots his speckled wings with sundry colours now there are some kinds of these sorceries mentioned by lucan concerning that sorceress thessala calling up ghosts where he saith here all natures products unfortunate fomr foam of mad dogs which waters fear and hate guts of the lynx hyenas knot imbred the marrow of a hart with serpents fed were not wanting no nor the sea lamprey which stops the ships nor yet the dragons eye and such as apuleius tells of concerning pamphila that sorceress endeavouring to procure love to whom fotis a certain maid brought the haires of a goat cut off from a bag or botle bottle made with the skin thereof instead of botius a young mans haires now she saith he being out of her wits for the young man goeth up to the tyled rough tiled roof and in the upper part thereof makes a great hole open to all the orientall and other aspects and most fit for these her arts and there privately worships having before furnished her mournfull house with sutable furniture with all kinds of spices with plates of iron with strange words engraven upon them with sterns of ships that were cast away and much lamented and with divers members of buryed carkasses buried carcasses cast abroad here noses and fingers there the fleshy nailes of those that were hanged and in another place the blood of them that were murdered and their skulls mangled with the teeth of wild beasts then she offers sacrifices their inchanted entralls enchanted entrails lying panting and sprinkles them with divers kinds of liquors sometimes with fountain water sometimes with cowes milk sometimes with mountain honey and mead then she ties those haires into knots and layes them on the fire with divers odours to be burnt then presently with an irresistible power of magick and blind force of the gods the bodies of those whose haires did smoke and crash assume the spirit of a man and feel and hear and walk and come whither the stink of their haire led them and insteed of botius the young man come skipping and leaping with joy and love into the house austin augustine also reports that he heard of some women sorceresses that were so versed in these kind of arts that by giving cheese to men they could presently turn them into working cattell cattle and the work being done restored them into men again chap xlii of the wonderful vertues of some kinds of sorceries now i will shew you what some of the sorceries are that by the example of these there may be a way opened for the consideration of the whole subject of them of these therefore the first is menstruous bloud blood which how much power it hath in sorcery we will now consider for as they say if it comes over new wine it makes it soure and if it doth but touch the vine it spoyles spoils it for ever and by its very touch it makes all plants and trees barren and they that be newly set to die it burns up all the hearbs herbs in the garden and makes fruit fall off from the trees it darkens the brightness of a looking glass dulls the edges of knives and razors dims the beauty of ivory and makes iron presently rusty it makes brass rust and smell very strong it makes dogs mad if they do but tast taste of it and if they being thus mad shall bite any one that wound is incurable it kils kills whole hives of bees and drives them from the hives that are but touched with it it makes linnen linen black that are boyled boiled it makes mares cast their foal if they do but touch it and makes women miscarry if they be but smeared with it it makes asses barren as long as they eat of the corn that hath been touched with it the ashes of menstruous clothes if they be cast upon purple garments that are to be washed change the colour of them and takes away colours from flowers they say that it drives away tertian and quartane agues if it be put into the wooll of a black ram and tyed tied up in a silver bracelet as also if the soles of the patients feet be noynted anointed therewith and especially if it be done by the woman her self the patients not knowing of it moreover it cures the fits of the falling sickness but most especially it cures them that are affraid afraid of water or drink after they are bitten with a mad dog if onely a menstruous cloth be put under the cup besides they report that if menstruous women shall walk naked about the standing corn they make all cankars cankers worms beetles flyes flies and all hurtfull things fall off from the corn but they must take heed that they do it before sun rising sunrise or else they will make the corn to wither also they say that they are able to expell hail tempests and lightnings more of which pliny makes mention of know this that they are a greater poyson poison if they happen in the decrease of the moon and yet much greater if they happen betwixt the decrease and change of the moon but if they happen in the eclypse eclipse of the moon or sun they are an incurable poyson poison but they are of greatest force of all when they happen in the first years even in the years of virginity for if they do but touch the posts of the house there can no mischeif mischief take effect in it also they say that the threads of any garment touched therewith cannot be burnt and if they be cast into the fire it will spread no further also it is said that the root of peony being given with castor oil and smeared over with a menstruous cloth cureth the falling sickness moreover if the stomack stomach of a hart be burnt or rosted roasted and to it be put a perfuming made with a menstruous cloth it will make crassbows crossbows useless for the killing of any game the haires of a menstruous woman put under dung breed serpents and if they be burnt will drive away serpents with their smell so great a poysonous poisonous force is in them that they are poyson poison to poysonous poisonous creatures there is also hippomanes which amongst sorceries is not the least taken notice of and it is a little venemous venomous piece of flesh as big as a fig and black which is in the forehead of a colt newly foaled which unless the mare her self doth presently eat she will never after love her foals or let it suck and for this cause they say there is a most wonderful power in it to procure love if it be powdered and drank in a cup with the blood of him that is in love there is also another sorcery which is called by the same name viz hippomanes viz a venemous venomous humour issuing out of the share of a mare what time she desires a horse of which virgill makes mention when he sings hence comes that poison which the shepherds call hippomanes and from mares groines doth fall the wofull woeful bane of cruell stepdames use and with a charme mongst powerfull drugs infuse of this doth juvenall the satyrist satirist make mention hippomanes poysons poisons that boyled boiled are and charmes are given to sons in law with such like harmes apollonius also in his argonauticks makes mention of the hearb herb of prometheus which he saith groweth from corrupt blood dropping upon the earth whilest the vultur vulture was gnawing upon the liver of prometheus upon the hill caucasus the flowre flower of this hearb herb he saith is like saffron having a double stalk hanging out one farther then the other the length of a cubit the root under the earth as flesh newly cut sends forth a blackish juice as it were of a beech with which saith he if any one shall after he hath performed his devotion to proserpina smear over his body he cannot be hurt either with sword or fire also saxo gramaticus grammaticus writes that there was a certain man called froton who had a garment which when he had put on he could not be hurt with the point or edge of any weapon the civet cat also abounds with sorceries for as pliny reports the posts of a dore door being touched with her blood the arts of juglers jugglers and sorcerers are so invallid that the gods cannot be called up and will by no means be perswaded to talk with them also that they that are anoynted anointed with the ashes of the ankle bone of her left foot being decocted with the blood of a weesell weasel shall become odious to all the same also is done with the eye being decocted also it is said that the straight gut is administered against the injustice and corruption of princes and great men in power and for success of petitions and to conduce to ending of suits and controversies if any one hath never so little of it about him and that if it be bound unto the left arm it is such a present charm that if any man do but look upon a woman it will make her follow him presently and that the skin of her ie the civet cats forehead doth withstand bewitchings they say also that the blood of a basilisk which they call the blood of saturn hath such great force in sorcery that it procures for him that carryes it about him good success of his petitions from great men in power and of his prayers from god and also remedies of diseases and grant of any priveledge privilege they say also that a tyck tick if it be pulled out of the left eare of a dog and if be it altogether black hath great vertue in the prognostick of life for if the sick party shall answer him that brought it in who standing at his feet & shall ask of him concerning his disease there is certain hope of life and that he shall dye die if he make no answer they say also that a stone that is bit with a mad dog hath power to cause discord if it be put in drink and that he shall not be barked at by dogs that puts the tongue of a dog in his shooe shoe under his great toe especially if the hearb herb of the same name viz houndstongue be joyned with it and that a membrane of the secondines of a dog doth the same and that dogs will shun him that hath a dogs heart and pliny reports that there is a red toad that lives in bryers briars and brambles and is full of sorceries and doth wonderfull things for the little bone which is in his left side being cast into cold water makes it presently very hot by which also the rage of dogs is restrained and their love is procured if it be put in drink and if it be bound to any one it stirreth up lust on the contrary the litle bone which is on the right side makes hot water cold and that it can never be hot again unless that be taken out also it is said to cure quartanes if it be bound to the sick in a snakes skin as also all other feavors fevers and restrain love and lust and that the spleen and heart is an effectual remedy against the poisons of the said toad thus much pliny writes also it is said that the sword with which a man is slain hath wonderfull power in sorceries for if the snaffle of the bridle or spurs be made of it they say that with these any horse though never so wild may be tamed and gentled and that if a horse should be shod with shooes shoes made with it he would be most swift and fleet and never though never so hard rod rode tire but yet they will that some characters and names should be written upon it they say also if any man shall dip a sword wherewith men were beheaded in wine and the sick drink thereof he shall be cured of his quartane they say also that a cup of liquor being made with the brains of a bear and drank out of the skull shall make him that drinks it to be as fierce and as raging as a bear and think himself to be changed into a bear and judge all things he sees to be bears and so to continue in that madness untill the force of that draught shall be dissolved no other distemper being all the while perceived in him chap xliii of perfumes or suffumigations their manner and power some suffumigations also or perfumings that are proper to the stars are of great force for the opportune receiving of celestiall gifts under the rayes of the stars in as much as they do strongly work upon the aire and breath for our breath is very much changed by such kind of vapours if both vapours be of another like the aire also being through the said vapours easily moved or affected with the qualities of inferiours or those celestiall daily and quickly penetrating our breast and vitals doth wonderfully reduce us to the like qualities wherefore suffumigations are wont to be used to by them that are about to soothsay soothsay for to affect their fancy which indeed being duly appropriated to any certain deities do fit us to receive divine inspiration so they say that fumes made with linseed linseed and fleabane seed and roots of violets and parsly parsley doth make one to foresee foresee things to come and doth conduce to prophecying let no man wonder how great things suffumigations can do in the aire especially when he shall with porphyrius porphyry consider that by certain vapours exhaling from proper suffumigations airy spirits are presently raised as also thundrings and lightnings and such like things as the liver of a chamelion chameleon being burnt on the top of the house doth as it is manifest raise showers and lightnings in like manner the head and throat if they be burnt with oken oaken wood cause storms and lightnings there are also suffumigations under opportune influencies of stars that make the images of spirits forthwith appear in the aire or elswhere so they say that if of coriander smallage henbane and hemlock be made a fume that spirits will presently come together hence they are called spirits hearbs herbs also it is said that a fume made of the root of the reedy hearb herb sagapen with the juice of hemlock and henbane and the hearb herb tapsus barbatus red sanders and black poppy makes spirits and strange shapes appear and if smallage be added to them chaseth away spirits from any place and destroyes their visions in like manner a fume made of calamint peony mints and palma christi drives away all evil spirits and vain imaginations moreover it is said that by certain fumes certain animals are gathered together and put to flight as pliny mentions concerning the stone liparis that with the fume thereof all beasts are called out so the bones in the upper part of the throat of a hart being burnt gather all the serpents together but the horn of the hart being burnt doth with its fume chase them all away the same doth a fume of the feathers of peacocks also the lungs of an asse being burnt puts all poisonous things to flight the fume of the burnt hoof of a horse drives away mice the same doth the hoof of a mule with which also if it be the hoof of the left foot flies are driven away and they say if a house or any place be smoaked smoked with the gall of a cutle fish cuttlefish made into a confection with red storax roses and lignumaloes and if then there be some sea water or blood cast into that place the whole house will seem to be full of water or blood and if some earth of plowed ground be cast there the earth will seem to quake now such kinds of vapours we must conceive do infect any body and infuse a vertue into it which doth continue long even as any contagious or poisonous vapour of the pestilence being kept for two yeers years in the wall of a house infect the inhabitants and as the contagion of pestilence or leprosie leprosy lying hid in a garment doth long after infect him that wears it therefore were certain suffumigations used to images rings and such like instruments of magick and hid treasures and as porphyrius porphyry saith very effectually so they say if any one shall hide gold or silver or any other pretious precious thing the moon being in conjunction with the sun and shall fume the place with coriander saffron henbane smallage and black poppy of each a like quantity bruised together and tempered with the juice of hemlock that which is so hid shall never be found or taken away and that spirits shall continually keep it and if any one shall endeavour to take it away he shall be hurt by them and shall fall into a frensie frenzy and hermes saith that there is nothing like the fume of sperma ceti spermaceti for the raising of spirits wherefore if a fume be made of that and lignumaloes pepperwort musk saffron red storax tempered together with the blood of a lapwing it will quickly gather airy spirits together and if it be used about the graves of the dead it gathers together spirits and the ghosts of the dead so as often as we direct any work to the sun we must make suffumigations with solary things if to the moon with lunary things and so of the rest and we must know that as there is a contrariety and enmity in stars and spirits so also in suffumigations unto the same so there is also a contrariety betwixt lignumaloes and sulphur frankincense and quicksilver quicksilver and spirits that are raised by the fume of lignumaloes are allayed by the burning of sulphur as proclus gives an example of a spirit which was wont to appear in the form of a lion but by the setting of a cock before it vanished away because there is a contrariety betwixt a cock and a lyon lion and so the like consideration and practise is to be observed concerning such like things et dicit hermes quod sperma ceti in suffitu non habet sibi par ad alliciendos daemones quare si ex eo et lignum aloes costo musco croco thymiamata cum sanguine upupae distemperatis fiat suffitus valde cito congregat spiritus aereos and hermes said that the spermaceti has no equal for attracting the daemons wherefore if you make an incense from it along with lignum aloes costus musk crocus and frankincense combined with the blood of a hoopoe when fumigated will very quickly congregate the aerial spirits this is from raziel ff vr v eg sl r chap xliv the composition of some fumes appropriated to the planets we make a suffumigation for the sun in this manner viz of saffron ambergryse amber musk lignumaloes lignumbalsaim lignum balsam the fruit of the laurell cloves myrrh and frankincense all which being bruised and mixt in such a proportion as may make a sweet odour must be incorporated with the brain of an eagle or the blood of a white cock after the manner of pils pills or trochiscks troches lat reads ambra amber not ambergris jhp for the moon we make a suffumigation of the head of a frog dryed dried the eyes of a bull the seed of white poppy frankincense and camphir camphor which must be incorporated with menstruous blood or the blood of a goose for saturne take the seed of black poppy of henbane root of mandrake the loadstone loadstone and myrrh and make them up with the brain of a cat or the blood of a bat for jupiter take the seed of ash lignumaloes storax the gum benjamin benzoin the lazule lazuli stone the tops of the feathers of a peacock and incorporate them with the blood of a stork or a swallow or the brain of a hart for mars take euphorbium bdellium gum armoniack the roots of both hellebors hellebores the load stone loadstone and a little sulphur and incorporate them all with the brain of a hart the blood of a man and the blood of a black cat for venus take musk ambergryse amber lignumaloes red roses and red corall and make them up with the brain of sparrows and the blood of pigeons for mercury take mastick frankincense cloves and the hearb herb cinquefoile and the stone achates and incorporate them all with the brain of a fox or weesel weasel and the blood of a pie magpie besides to saturne are appropriated for fumes all odoriferous roots as pepperwort root &c and the frankincense tree to jupiter odoriferous fruits as nutmegs cloves to mars all odoriferous wood as sanders sandalwood cypress lignumbalsaim lignum balsam and lignumaloes to the sun all gums frankincense mastick benjamin storax laudanum labdanum ie cistus ambergryse ambergris and musk to venus flowers as roses violets saffron and such like to mercury all pils peels of wood and fruit as cinnamon lignum cassia mace citron pill lemon peel and bayberries and whatsoever seeds are odoriferous to the moon the leaves of all vegetables as the leaf indum the leaves of the myrtle and baytree know also that according to the opinion of the magicians in every good matter as love good will and the like there must be a good fume odoriferous and pretious precious and in every evill matter as hatred anger misery and the like there must be a stinking fume that is of no worth the twelve signes also of the zodiack have their proper fumes as aries hath myrrh taurus pepperwort pepperwort gemini mastick cancer camphir camphor leo frankincense virgo sanders sandalwood libra galbanum scorpio opoponax sagittarius lignumaloes capricornus benjamin benzoin aquarius euphorbium pisces red storax but hermes describes the most powerfull fume to be viz that which is compounded of the seven aromaticks according to the powers of the seven planets for it receives from saturne pepperwort pepperwort from jupiter nutmeg from mars lignumaloes from the sun mastick from venus saffron from mercury cinnamon and from the moon the myrtle chap xlv of collyries unctions lovemedicines and their vertues moreover collyries and unguents conveying the vertues of things naturall and celestiall to our spirit can multiply transmute transfigure and transform it accordingly as also transpose those vertues which are in them into it that so it cannot act only upon its own body but also upon that which is neer near it and affect that by visible rayes charmes and by touching it with some like quality for because our spirit is the subtile pure lucid airy and unctuous vapour of the blood it is therefore fit to make collyries of the like vapours which are more sutable suitable to our spirit in subtance for then by reason of their likeness they do the more stir up attract and transform the spirit the like vertues have certain ointments and other confections hence by the touch sometimes sickness poisonings and love is induced some things as the hands or garments being anointed also by kisses some things being held in the mouth love is induced as in virgil we read that venus prayes cupid that when glad dido hugs him in her lap at royall feasts crownd with the cheering grape when she imbracing embracing shall sweet kisses give inspire hid flame with deadly bane deceive he would now the sight because it perceives more purely and cleerly clearly then the other senses and fastening in us the marks of things more acutely and deeply doth most of all and before others agree with the phantastick spirit as is apparent in dreams when things seen do more often present themselves to us then things heard or any thing coming under the other senses therefore when collyries transform visuall spirits that spirit doth easily affect the imagination which indeed being affected with divers species and forms transmits the same by the same spirit unto the outward sense of sight by which occasion there is caused in it a perception of such species and forms in that manner as if it were moved by externall objects that there seem to be seen terrible images and spirits and such like so there are made collyries making us forthwith to see the images of spirits in the aire or elsewhere as i know how to make of the gall of a man and the eyes of a black cat and of some other things the like is made also of the blood of a lapwing of a bat and of a goat and they say if a smooth shining piece of steel be smeered smeared over with the juice of mugwort and made to fume it will make invocated spirits to be seen in it so also there are some suffumigations or unctions which make men speak in their sleep to walk and to do those things which are done by men that are awake and sometimes to do those things which men that are awake cannot or dare not do some there are that make us to hear horrid or delectable sounds and such like and this is the cause why maniacall and melancholy men believe they see and hear those things without which their imagination doth only fancy within hence they fear things not to be feared and fall into wonderfull and most false suspicions and fly when none pursueth them are angry and contend no body being present and fear where no fear is such like passions also can magicall confections induce by suffumigations by collyries by unguents by potions by poisons by lamps and lights by looking glasses by images enchantments charms sounds and musick also by divers rites observations ceremonies religions and superstitions all which shall be handled in their places and not only by these kind of arts passions apparitions and images induced but also things themselves which are really changed and transfigured into divers forms as the poet relates of proteus periclimenus acheloas and merra the daughter of erisichthon so also circe changed the companions of ulysses & of old in the sacrifices of jupiter lycus the men that tasted of the inwards of the sacrifices were turned into wolves which pliny saith befell a certain man called demarchus the same opinion was austin augustine of for he saith whilest he was in italy he heard of some women that by giving sorceries in cheese to travellors travelers turned them into working catle cattle and when they had done such work as they would have them turned them into men again and that this befell a certain father called prestantius the scriptures themselves testify that pharaos pharaohs sorcerers turned their rods into serpents and water into blood and did such like things chapter xlvi of naturall alligations and suspensions when the soul of the world by its vertue doth make all things that are naturally generated or artificially made fruitfull by infusing into them celestiall properties for the working of some wonderfull effects then things themselves not only when applyed by suffumigations or collyries or oyntments ointments or potions or any other such like way but also when they being conveniently wrapt wrapped up are bound to or hanged about the neck or in any other way applyed although by never so easy a contact do impress their vertue upon us by these alligations therefore suspensions wrappings up applications and contacts the accidents of the body and mind are changed into sickness health boldness fear sadness and joy and the like they render them that carry them gratious gracious or terrible acceptable or rejected honoured and beloved or hatefull and abominable now these kind of passions are conceived to be by the abovesaid infused no otherwise then is manifest in the graffing grafting of trees where the vitall vertue is sent and communicated from the trunk to the twig graffed grafted into it by way of contact and alligation so in the female palme tree when she comes neer to the male her boughs bend to the male and are bowed which the gardeners seeing bind ropes from the male to the female which becomes straight again as if it had by this continuation of the rope received the vertue of the male in like manner we see that the crampfish being touched afar off with a long pole doth presently stupify stupefy the hand of him that toucheth it and if any shall touch the sea hare with his hand or stick doth presently run out of his wits also if the fish called stella starfish as they say being fastned fastened with the blood of a fox and a brass nail to a gate evill medicines can do no hurt also it is said that if a woman take a needle and beray it with dung and then wrap it up in earth in which the carkass carcass of a man was buryed buried and shall carry it about her in a cloth which was used at the funerall that no man shall be able to ly have sex with her as long as she hath it about her now by these examples we see how by certain alligations of certain things as also suspensions or by a simple contact or the continuation of any thread we may be able to receive some vertues thereby it is necessary that we know the certain rule of alligation and suspension and the manner which the art requires viz that they be done under a certain and sutable suitable constellation and that they be done with wyer wire or silken threads with hair or sinews of certain animals and things that are to be wrapped up must be done in the leaves of hearbs herbs or the skins of animals or fine cloths and the like according to the sutableness suitability of things as if you would procure the solary vertue of any thing this being wrapped up in bay leaves or the skin of a lion hang it about thy neck with a golden thread or a silken thread of a yallow yellow colour whilest the sun rules in the heaven so thou shalt be endued with the solary vertue of that thing but if thou dost desire the vertue of any saturnine thing thou shalt in like maner take that thing whilest saturn raignes and wrap it up in the skin of an ass or in a cloth used at a funerall especially if thou desirest it for sadness and with a black thread hang it about thy neck in like manner we must conceive of the rest chapter xlvii of rings and their compositions rings also which were alwaies much esteemed of by the ancients when they are opportunely made do in like manner impress their vertue upon us in as much as they do affect the spirit of him that carries them with gladness or sadness and render him courteous or terrible bold or fearfull amiable or hatefull in as much as they do fortifie us against sickness poisons enemies evill spirits and all manner of hurtfull things or at least will not suffer us to be kept under them now the manner of making these kinds of rings is this viz when any star ascends fortunately with the fortunate aspect or conjunction of the moon we must take a stone and hearb herb that is under that star and make a ring of the metall that is sutable suitable to this star and in it fasten the stone putting the hearb herb or root under it not omitting the inscriptions of images names and characters as also the proper suffumigations but we shall speak more of these in another place where we shall treat of images and characters so we read in philostratus jarchus that a wise prince of the indians bestowed seven rings made after this manner marked with the vertues and names of the seven planets to apollonius of which he wore every day one distinguishing them according to the names of the dayes by the benefit of which he lived above one hundred and thirty years as also alwaies retained the beauty of his youth in like manner moses the lawgiver and ruler of the hebrews being skilled in the egyptian magick is said by josephus to have made rings of love and oblivion there was also as saith aristotle amongst the cireneans a ring of battus which could procure love and honour we read also that eudamus a cerain philosopher made rings against the bites of serpents bewitchings and evil spirits the same doth josephus relate of solomon also we read in plato that gygus king of lydia had a ring of wonderfull and strange vertues the seal of which when he turned it toward the palm of his hand no body could see him but he could see all things by the opportunity of which ring he ravished the queen and slew the king his master and killed whomsoever he thought stood in his way and in these villanies no body could see him and at length by the benefit of this ring be became king of lydia chapter xlviii of the vertue of places and what places are sutable to every star there be wonderfull vertues of places accompanying them either from things there placed or by the influences of the stars or in any other way for as pliny relates of a cuckow cuckoo in what place any one doth first hear him if his right foot be marked about and and that footstep footprint digged up there will no fleas be bred in that place where it is scattered so they say that the dust of the track of a snake being gathered up and scattered amongst bees makes them return to their hives so also that the dust in which a mule hath rolled himself being cast upon the body doth mitigate the heat of love and that the dust wherein a hawk hath rolled her self if it be bound to the body in a bright red cloth cures the quartane so doth the stone taken out of the nest of a swallow as they say presently relieve those that have the falling sickness epilepsy and being bound to the party continually preserve them especially if it be rolled in the blood or heart of a swallow and it is reported that if any one shall cut a veine and being fasting shall go over a place where any one lately fell with the fit of a falling sickness epilepsy that he shall fall into the same disease and pliny reports that to fasten an iron naile in that place where he that fell with a fit of the falling sickness first pitched his head will free him from his disease so they say that an hearb herb growing upon the head of any image being gathered and bound up in some part of ones garment with a red thread shall presently allay the headach headache and that any hearb herb gathered out of the brooks or rivers before sun rising and no body see him that gathers it shall cure the tertian if it be bound to the left arm the sick party not knowing what is done but amongst places that are appropriated to the stars all stinking places dark underground religious and monrnfull places as churchyards tombes and houses not inhabited by men and old tottering obscure dreadfull houses and solitary dens caves and pits also fishponds standing pools fennes and such like are appropriated to saturne unto jupiter are ascribed all privileged places consistories of noble men tribunals chaires places for exercises schools and all beautifull and clean places scattered or sprinkled with divers odours to mars fiery and bloody places furnaces bakehouses shambles places of execution and places where there have been great battailes battles fought and slaughters made and the like to the sun light places the serene aire kings pallaces palaces and princes courts pulpits theators theaters thrones and all kingly and magnificent places to venus pleasant fountains green meadows flowrishing flourishing gardens garnished beds stews and according to orpheus the sea the sea shore baths dancingplaces and all places belonging to women to mercury shops schools warehouses warehouses exchange for merchants and the like to the moon wildernesses woods rocks hils hills mountains forrests forests fountains waters rivers seas seashores ships groves highwaies highways and granaries for corn and such like upon this account they that endeavor to procure love are wont to bury for a certain time the instruments of their art whether they be rings images lookingglasses or any other or hide them in a stew house because in that place they will contract some venerall faculty no otherwise then things that stand in stinking places become stinking and those in an aromaticall place become aromaticall and of a sweet savour the four corners of the earth also pertain to this matter hence they that are to gather a saturnall martiall or joviall hearb herb must look towards the east or south partly because they desire to be orientall from the sun and partly because of their principall houses viz aquarius scorpius scorpio sagittarius are southern signes so also are capricornus and pisces but they that will gather a venerall mercuriall or lunary hearb herb must look towards the west because they delight to be western or else they must look northward because their principall houses viz taurus gemini cancer virgo are northern signes so in any solary work we must look towards the eas or south but rather towards the solary body and light chapter xlix of light colours candles and lamps and to what stars houses and elements severall colours are ascribed light also is a quality that partakes much of form and is a simple act and a representation of the understanding it is first diffused from the mind of god into all things but in god the father the father of light it is the first true light then in the son a beautifull overflowing brightness and in the holy ghost a burning brightness exceeding all intelligencies yea as dyonisius saith of seraphins in angels therefore it is a shining intelligence diffused an abundant joy beyond all bounds of reason yet received in divers degrees according to the nature of the intelligence that receives it then it descends into the celestiall bodies where it becomes a store of life and an effectuall propagation even a visible splendor in the fire a certain naturall liveliness infused into it by the heavens and lastly in men it is a clear discourse of reason an knowledge of divine things and the whole rationall but this is manifold either by reason of the disposition of the body as the peripateticks will have it or which is more true by reason of the good pleasure of him that bestows it who gives it to every one as he pleaseth from thence it passeth to the fancy yet above the sense but only imaginable and thence to the sence senses but especially to that of the eyes in them it becomes a visible clearness and is extended to other perspicuous bodies in which it becomes a colour and a shining beauty but in dark bodies it is a certain beneficiall and generative vertue and penetrates to the very center where the beames of it being collected into a narrow place it becomes a dark heat tormenting and scorching so that all things perceive the vigour of the light according to their capacity all which joyning to it self with an enlivening heat and passing through all things doth convey its qualities and vertues through all things therefore magicians forbid the urin urine of a sick man to be sprinkled in the shadow a sick man or to be uncovered against the sun or the moon because the rayes of the light penetrating bringing suddenly with it the noxious qualities of the sick bodies convey them into the opposite body and affect that with a quality of the same kind this is the reason why enchanters have a care to cover their enchantments with their shadow so the civet cat make all dogs dumb with the very touch of her shadow also there are made artificially some lights by lamps torches candles and such like of some certain thing and liquors opportunely chosen according to the rule of the stars and composed amongst themselves according to their congruity which when they be lighted and shine alone are wont to produce some wonderfull and celestiall effects which men many times wonder at as pliny reports out of anaxilaus of a poison of mares after copulation which being lighted in torches doth monstrously represent a sight of horse heads the like may be done of asses and flies which being tempered with wax & lighted make a strange sight of flies and the skin of a serpent lighted in a lamp maketh serpents appear and they say when grapes are in their flower if any one shall bind a viall to them full of oile and shall let it alone till they be ripe and then the oile be lighted in a lamp it makes grapes to be seen and so in other fruits if centory be mixed with honey and the blood of a lapwing and be put in a lamp they that stand about will seem a great deal bigger then they are wont and if it be lighted in a clear night the stars will seem to be scattered the one from the other such force also is in the inke of the cuttle fish that it being put into a lamp makes blackmores blackamoors appear it is also reported that a candle made of some certain saturnine things if being lighted it be extinguished in the mouth of a man newly dead will afterwards as oft as it shines alone bring great sadness and fear upon them that stand about it of such like torches lamps doth hermes speak more of also plato and chyrannides and of the latter writers albertus in a certain treatise of this particular thing colours also are a kind of lights which being mixed with things are wont to expose them to those stars to which they are agreeable and we shall afterwards speak of some colours which are the lights of the planets by which even the natures of fixed stars themselves are understood which also may be applyed to the flames of lamps and candles but in this place we shall relate how the colours of inferiour mixt things are distributed to divers planets for all colours black lucid earthy leaden brown have relation to saturne saphire sapphire and airy colours and those which are alwaies green clear purple darkish golden mixed with silver belong to jupiter red colours and burning fiery flaming violet purple bloody and iron colours resemble mars golden saffron purple and bright colours resemble the sun but all white fair curious green ruddy betwixt saffron and purple resemble venus mercury and the moon moreover amongst the houses of the heaven signes of the zodiac the first and seventh hath white colour the second and twelfth green the third and eleventh saffron the fourth and the tenth red the fift and ninth honey colour the sixt and eighth black the elements also have their colours by which naturall philosophers judge of the complexion and property of their nature for an earthy colour caused of coldness and dryness is brown and black and manifests black choller choler and a saturnine nature the blew blue tending towards whiteness doth denote flegme phlegm for cold makes white moisture and dryness makes black reddish colour shews blood but fiery flaming burning hot shew choller choler which by reason of its subtilty and aptness to mix with others doth cause divers colours more for if it be mixed with blood and blood be most predominant it makes a florid red if choller choler predominate it makes a redish reddish colour if there be an equall mixtion it makes a sad red but if adust choller choler be mixed with blood it makes a hempen colour and red if blood predominate and somewhat red if choller choler prevaile but if it be mixed with a melancholy humour it makes a black colour but with malancholy melancholy and flegme phlegm together in an equall proportion it makes a hempen colour if flegme phlegm abound a mud colour if melancholy a blewish bluish but if it be mixed with flegme phlegm alone in an equall proportion it makes a citrine citron colour if unequally a pale or palish now all colours are more prevalent when they be in silk or in metals or in perspicuous substances or pretious precious stones and in those things which resemble celestiall bodies in colour especially in living things chapter l of fascination and the art thereof fascination is a binding which comes from the spirit of the witch through the eyes of him that is bewitched entering to his heart now the instrument of fascination is the spirit viz a certain pure lucid subtile vapour generated of the purer blood by the heat of the heart this doth alwaies send forth through the eyes rayes like to it self those rayes being sent forth do carry with them a spirituall vapour and that vapour a blood as it appears in bleer bleary and red eyes whose raies rays being sent forth to the eyes of him that is opposite and looks upon them carries the vapour of the corrupt blood together with it self by the contagion of which it doth infect the eyes of the beholder with the like disease so the eye being opened and intent upon any one with a strong imagination doth dart its beams which are the vehiculum of the spirit into the eyes of him that is opposite to him which tender spirit strikes the eyes of him that is bewitched being stirred up from the heart of him that strikes and possesseth the breast of him that is stricken wounds his heart and infects his spirit whence apuleius saith thy eyes sliding down through my eyes into mine inward breast stir up a most vehement burning in my marrow know therefore that men are most bewitched when with often beholding they direct the edge of their sight to the edg edge of their sight that bewitch them and when their eyes are reciprocally intent one upon the other and when raies rays are joyned to raies and lights to lights for then the spirit of the one is joyned to the spirit of the other and fixeth its sparks so are strong ligations made and so most vehement loves are inflamed with the only raies of the eyes even with a certain sudden looking on as if it were with a dart or stroke penetrating the whole body whence then the spirit and amorous blood being thus wounded are carried forth upon the lover and enchanter no otherwise then the blood and spirit of the vengeance of him that is slain are upon him that slayes him whence lucretius sang concerning those amorous bewitchings the body smitten is but yet the mind is wounded with the darts of cupid blind all parts do simpathize sympathize i th wound but know the blood appears in that which had the blow so great is the power of fascination especially when the vapours of the eyes are subservient to the affection therefore witches use collyries ointments alligations and such like to affect and corroborate the spirit this or that manner to procure love they use venereall collyries as hippomanes the blood of doves or sparrows and such like to induce fear they use martiall collyries as of the eyes of wolves the civet cat and the like to procure misery or sickness they use saturnine and so of the rest chapter li of certain observations producing wonderfull vertues they say that certain acts and observations have a certain power of naturall things that they believe diseases may be expelled or brought thus and thus so they say that quartanes may be driven away if the parings of the nails of the sick be bound to the neck of a live eel in a linnen clout linen cloth and she be let go into the water and pliny saith that the paring of a sick mans nailes of his feet and hands being mixed with wax cure the quartan tertian and quotidian ague and if they be before sun rising fastened to another mans gate will cure such like diseases in like manner let all the parings of the nailes be put into pismires caves anthills and they say that that which begun to draw the nailes first must be taken and bound to the neck and by this means will the disease be removed they say that by wood stricken with lightning and cast behind the back with ones hands any disease may be cured and in quartanes a piece of a naile from a gibbet wrapt up in wooll and hanged about the neck cures them also a rope doth the like that is taken from a gallows and hid under ground that the sun cannot reach it also the throat of him that hath a hard swelling or imposthume aposteme abscess being touched with the hand of him that dyed died by an immature death is cured thereby also they say that a woman is presently eased of her hard travel labor if any one shall put into the bed where the woman in travel labor is a stone or dart with which either of these animals viz a man a boar or a bear were at one blow killed the same also as they say doth a spear that is pulled out of the body of a man if it shall not first touch the ground also they say that arrows pulled out of the body of a man if they have not touched the earth and be put under any one lying down will procure love also they say that the falling sickness is cured by meat made of the flesh of a wild beast slain in the same manner as a man is slain also they say that a mans eyes that are washed three times with the water wherein he hath washed his feet shall never be sore or bleer bleary it is said that some do cure diseases of the groin with threed thread taken out of the weavers loom being tyed tied in nine or seven knots the name of some widow being named at every knot also the spleen of catle cattle extended upon pained spleens cures them if he that applies it saith that he is applying a medicine to the spleen to cure and ease it after this they say the patient must be shut into a sleeping room the dore door being sealed up with a ring and some verse be repeated over nineteen times the urine of a green lizard cures the same disease if it be hanged up in a pot before the patients bedchamber so that he may as he comes in and out touch it with his hand also a lizard killed in the urine of a calf as they say retains his lust that put it in but he that shall put his own urine into a dogs urine is said to be made thereby dull to venerous acts and to feel a benummedness in his loins they say that if ones own urine be dropped upon the foot in the morning it is a remedy against all evil medicines and a little frog climbing up a tree if any one shall spit in his mouth and then let him escape is said to cure the cough it is a wonderfull thing but easy to experience what pliny speaks of if any one shall be sorry for any blow that he hath given another afar off or nigh at hand if he shall presently spit into the middle of that hand with which he gave the blow the party that was smitten shall presently be freed from pain this hath been approved of in a fourfooted beast that hath been sorely hurt some there are that aggravate the blow before they give it in like maner spitle spittle carried in the hand or to spit in the shooe shoe of the right foot before it be put on is good when any one passeth through a dangerous place they say that wolves will not come to a field if one of them be taken and the blood let by little and little out of his legs being unbroken with a knife and sprinkled about the outsides of the field and he himself be buried in that place from which he was first drawn the methanenses citizens of trezenium accounted it as a present remedy for preserving of vines from the wrong of the southern wind having alwaies found it by most certain experience if whilest the wind blows a white cock should be pulled to pieces in the middle by two men both which keeping their part must walk round the vineyard and both meeting in the place from whence they began their circuit must that place bury the pieces of the cock they say also that if any one shall hold a viper over a vapour with a staffe he shall prophecy and that the staffe wherewith a snake was beaten is good against diseases of breeding women these things pliny recites it is said also in gathering roots and hearbs herbs we must draw three circles round about them first with a sword then dig them up taking heed in the mean time of a contrary wind also they say that if any one shall measure a dead man with a rope first from the elbow to the biggest finger then from the shoulder to the same finger and afterwards from the head to the feet making thrice those mensurations if any one afterward shall be measured with the same rope in the same maner he shall not prosper but be unfortunate and fall into misery and sadness and albertus out of chyrannis saith that if any woman hath enchanted thee to love her take the sheet gown she lies in and piss through her hood and her right sleeve out of doors and the enchantment will be quitted and pliny saith that to sit by women great with child pregnant or when a medicine is given to any one of them the fingers being joyned joined together like the teeth of a kemb comb is a charm this was known by experience in alcumena breeding hercules and so much the worse if that be done about one or both knees also to sit cross legged is sorcery therefore it was forbiden forbidden to be done in the counsels of princes and rulers as a thing which hindred all acts and it is said if any one standing before the door call the man by his name that is lying with a woman and he answer if then he fasten a knife or needle on the door and break it the edge being downward he that is in the bed with the woman cannot couple with her as long as those things shall be there chapter lii of the countenance and gesture the habit and figure of the body and to what stars any of these do answer whence physiognomy and metoposcopy and chyromancy chiromancy arts of divination have their grounds the countenance gesture the motion setting and figure of the body being accidentall to us conduce to the receiving of celestiall gifts and expose us to the superiour bodies and produce certain effects in us no otherwise then in hellebor which when thou gatherest if thou pullest the leaf upward it draws the humors upward and causeth vomiting if downward it causeth purging by drawing the humor downward how much also the countenauce gesture do affect the sight imagination and animall spirit no man is ignorant so they that couple for generation for the most part are wont to make an impression on the children that are then begotten of that countenance which they themselves then form or imagine so a mild and cheerfull countenance of a prince in the city makes the people joyfull but fierce and sad terrifies them so the gesture and countenance of any one lamenting doth easily move to pitty pity so the shape of an amiable person doth easily excite to love thou must know that such like gestures and figures as harmonies of the body do expose it no otherwise to the celestials then odours and the spirit of a medicine and internall passions do the soul for as medicines and passions of the mind are by certain dispositions of the heaven increased so also the gesture and motion of the body do get an efficacy by certain influences of the heavens for there are gestures resembling saturne which are melancholy and sad as are beating of the breast striking of the head also such as are religious as the bowing of the knee and a fixt look downwards as of one praying also weeping and such like as are used by an austere and saturnine man such an one as the satyrist describes saying with hangd down head with eyes fixed to the ground his raging words bites in and muttering sound he doth express with powting pouting lips a cheerfull and honest countenance a worshipfull gesture clapping of the hands as of one rejoycing rejoicing and praising also the bending of the knee with the head lifted up as of one that is worshiping are ascribed to jupiter a sowre sour fierce cruell angry rough countenance and gesture are ascribed to mars solary are honourable and couragious courageous gestures and countenances also walkings abroad bending of the knee as of one honoring a king with one knee venereal are dances embraces laughters amiable and cheerfull countenances mercuriall are inconstant quick variable and such like gestures and countenances lunary are such as are moveable poisonfull and childish and the like and as we have spoke of gestures so also are the shapes of men distinct for saturne bespeaks a man to be of a black and yellowish colour lean crooked of a rough skin great veines hairy all over his body little eyes of a frowning forehead of a thin beard great lips eyes intent upon the ground of a heavy gate gait striking his feet together as he walks crafty witty a seducer and murderous jupiter signifies a man to be of a pale colour darkish red a handsome body good stature bold of great eyes not black altogether large pupill short nostrils not equall great teeth before curld hair of good disposition and manners mars makes a man red of a red hair round face yellowish eyes of a terrible and sharp looks bold jocund proud crafty the sun makes a man of a tauny tawny colour betwixt yellow and black dasht dashed with red of a short stature yet of a handsome body without much hair and curld of yellow eyes wise faithfull desirous of praise venus signifies a man to be tending towards blackness but more white with mixture of red of a handsome body a fair and round face fair hair fair eyes the blackness whereof is more intense of good manners and honest love also kind patient and jocund mercury signifies a man not much white or black of a long face high forehead fair eyes not black to have a streight straight and long nose thin beard long fingers to he ingenious a subtile inquisitor turncoat and subject to many fortunes the moon signifies a man to be in colour white mixed with a little red of a fair stature round face with some marks in it eyes not fully black frowning forehead also kind gentle sociable the signes also and faces of signes have their figures and shapes which he that would know must seek them out in books of astrology lastly upon these figures and gestures physiognomy and metoposcopy arts of divination do depend also chyromancy chiromancy foretelling future events not as causes but as signes through like effects caused by the same cause and although these divers kinds of divinations may seem to be done by inferiour and weak signes yet the judgements of them are not to be slighted or condemned when prognostication is made by them not out of superstition but by reason of the harmoniacall correspondency of all the parts of the body whosoever therefore doth the more exactly imitate the celestiall bodies either in nature study action motion gesture countenance passions of the mind and opportunity of the season is so much the more like to the heavenly bodies and can receive larger gifts from them chapter liii of divination and its kinds there are some other kinds of divinations depending upon naturall causes which are known to every one in his art and experience to be in divers things by which physitians physicians husbandmen shepheards shepherds mariners and every one of these out of probable signes do prognosticate many of these kinds aristotle made mention of in his book of times amongst which auguria and auspicia are the chiefest which were in former time in such esteem amongst the romanes that they would do nothing that did belong to private or publique public business without the counsell of the augures cicero also in his book of divinations largely declares that the people of tuscia would do nothing without this art now there are divers kinds of auspicias for some are called pedestria ie which are taken from fourfooted beasts some are called auguria which are taken from birds some are celestiall which are taken from thundrings and lightnings some are called caduca ie when any fell in the temple or elsewhere some were sacred which were taken from sacrifices some of these were called piacula and sad auspicia as when a sacrifice escaped from the altar or being smitten made a bellowing or fell upon another part of his body then he should to these is added exauguration viz when the rod fell out of the hand of the augure with which it was the custome to view and take notice of the aupicium michael scotus makes mention of twelve kinds of augurias viz six on the right hand the names of which he saith are fernova fervetus confert emponenthem sonnasarnova sonnasarvetus and the other six on the left hand the names of which are confernova confervetus viaram herrenam scassarnova and scassarvetus then expounding their names he saith fernova is an augurium when thou goest out of thy house to do any business and in going thou seest a man or a bird going or flying so that either of them set himself before thee upon thy left hand that is a good signification in reference to thy business fervetus is an augurium when thou shalt go out of thy house for to do any business and in going thou findest or seest a bird or a man resting himself before thee on the left side of thee that is an ill sign in reference to thy business viaram is an augurium when a man or a bird in his journey or flying passeth before thee coming from the right side of thee and bending toward the left goeth out of thy sight that is a good sign concerning thy business confernova is an augurium when thou dost first find a man or a bird going or flying and then he rest himself before thee on thy right side thou seeing of it that is a good sign concerning thy business confervetus is an augurium when first thou findest or seest a man or a bird bending from thy right side it is an ill sign concerning thy business scimasarnova is an augurium when a man or a bird comes behind thee and outgoeth thee but before he comes at thee he rests thou seeing of him on thy right side it is to thee a good sign scimasarvetus is an augurium when thou seest a man or bird behind thee but before he comes to thee he rests in that place thou seeing of it is a good sign confert is an augurium when a man or bird in journeying or flying shall pass behind thee coming from the left side of thee and bending toward thy right pass out of thy sight and is an evill sign concerning thy business scassarvetus is when thou seest a man or a bird passing by thee and resting in a place on thy left side it is an evill sign to thee scassarnova is when thou seest a man or a bird passing by thee and resting in a place on thy right side is an augurium of good to thee emponenthem is when a man or a bird coming from thy left side and passing to thy right goeth out of thy sight without resting it is a good sign hartena is an augurium if a man or a bird coming from thy right hand passing behind thy back to thy left and thou shall see him resting any where this is an evill sign thus much scotus the ancients did also prognosticate from sneesings sneezings of which homer in the seventeenth book of his odyssey makes mention because they thought they proceeded from a sacred place viz the head in which the intellect is vigourous and operative whence also whatsoever speech came into the breast or mind of a man rising in the morning unawares is said to be some presage and an augurium chapter liiii of divers certain animals and other things which have a signification in augurias auguries all the auspicia auspices which first happen in the beginning of any enterprise are to be taken notice of as if in the beginning of thy work thou shalt perceive that rats have gnawn thy garments desist from thy undertakings if going forth thou shalt stumble at the threshold or if in the way thou shalt dash thy foot against any thing forbear thy journey if any ill omen happen in the beginning of thy business put off thy undertakings least thy intentions be wholly frustrated or accomplished to no purpose but expect and wait for a fortunate hour for the dispatching of thy affairs with a better omen we see that many animals are by a naturall power imbred in them propheticall doth not the cock by his crowing diligently tell you the hours of the night and morning and with his wings spread forth chase away the lion and many birds with their singing and chattering and flies by their sharp pricking foretell rain and dolphins by their often leaping above the water forerun forwarn of tempests it would be too long to relate all the passages which the phrygians cilicians arabians umbrians tuscians and other peoples which follow the augurias learned by birds these they have proved by many experiments and examples for in all things the oracles of things to come are hid but those are the chiefest which ominall omenal birds shall foretell these are those which the poets relate were turned from men into birds therefore what the daw declares hearken and mark observing her setting as she sits and her manner of flying whether on the right hand or left whether clamorous or silent whether she goes before or follows after whether she waits for the approach of him that passeth by or flies from him and which way she goes all these things must be diligently observed orus apollo saith in his hyeroglyphicks hieroglyphics daws that are twins signifie marriage because this animall brings forth two eggs out of which male and female must be brought forth but if which seldom happens two males be generated or two females the males will not couple with any other females nor females with any other males but will alwaies live without a mate and solitary therefore they that meet a single daw divine thereby that they shall live a single life the same also doth a black hen pigeon betoken for after the death of her mate she alwaies lives single thou shalt as carefully observe crows which are as significant as daws yea and in greater matters it was epictetus the stoicks philosophers judgment who was a sage author that if a crow did croke croak over against any one it did betoken some evill either to his body fortune honour wife or children then thou shall take heed to swans who foreknow the secrets of the waters for their cheerfulness doth presage happy events not only to marriners mariners but all other travellers unless they be overcome by the coming over of a stronger bird as of an eagle who by the most potent majesty of her soveraignty sovereignty makes null the predictions of all other birds if she speaks to the contrary for she flies higher then all other birds and is of more acute sight and is never excluded from the secrets of jupiter she portends advancement and victory but by blood because she drinks no water but blood an eagle flying over the locrensians fighting against the crotoniensians gave them victory an eagle setting her self unawares upon the target of hiero going forth to the first war betokened that he should be king two eagles sitting all day upon the house at the birth of alexander of macedonia did portend to him an omen of two kingdomes viz asia and europe an eagle also taking off the hat of lucias tarquinius priscus son to demarathus the corinthian flying from home by reason of some discord and being come into hetraria and going to rome and then flying high with it and afterwards putting it upon his head again did portend to him the kingdome of the romans vulturs vultures signifie difficulty hardness ravenousness which was verified in the beginning of building of cities also they foretell the places of slaughter coming seven dayes before hand and because they have most respect to that place where the greatest slaughter shall be as if they gaped after the greatest number of the slain therefore the ancient kings were wont to send out spies to take notice what place the vulturs vultures had most respect to the phoenix promiseth singular good success which being seen anew rome was built very auspiciously the pellican pelican because she hazards her self for her young signifies that a man should out of the zeal of his love undergo much hardship the painted bird gave the name to the city of pictavia and foreshewed the lenity of that people by its colour and voice the heron is an augurium of hard things the stork is a bird of concord and makes concord cranes gives us notice of the trechery treachery of enemies the bird cacupha betokens gratitude for she alone doth express love to her dam mother being spent with old age on the contrary hippopotamus that kils kills his dam mother doth betoken ingratitude for good turn also injustice the bird origis is most envious and betokens envy amongst the smaller birds the pie is talkative and foretels foretells guests the bird albanellus flying by any one if from the left to the right betokens cheerfulness of entertainment if contrarywise betokens the contrary the scritch screech owl is alwaies unlucky so also is the horn owl who because she goes to her young by night unawares as death comes unawares is therefore said to foretell death yet sometimes because she is not blind in the dark of the night doth betoken diligence and watchfulness which she made good when she sate upon the spear of hiero dido when she sees the unlucky owl pittied pitied neas whence the poet sang the owl sitting on top of th house alone sends forth her sad complaints with mournfull tone and in another place the slothfull owl by mortals is esteemd a fatall omen the same same bird sang in the capitoll when the romane affaires were low at numantia and when fregelia was pulled down for a conspiracy made against the romans almadel saith that owls and nightravens when they turn aside to strange countries or houses betoken the death of the men of that country and those houses for those birds are delighted with dead carkases carcasses and perceive them before hand for men that are dying have a neer affinity with dead carkases carcasses the hawk also is a foreteller of contention as naso sings we hate the hawk because that arms amongst she alwaies lives lelius the embassadour of pompey was slain in spain amongst the purveyours which misfortune a hawk flying over the head is said to foretell and almadel saith that these kind of birds fighting amongst themselves signifie the change of a kingdome but if birds of another kind shall fight with them and are never seen to come together again it portends a new condition and state of that country also little birds by their coming to or departing from foreshew that a family shall be inlarged enlarged or lessened and their flight by how much the more serene it is by so much the more laudable whence melampus the augure conjectured at the slaughter of the greeks by the flight of little birds when he saith thou seest that no bird taketh his flight in fair weather swallows because when they are dying they provide a place of safety for their young do portend a great patrimony or legacy after the death of friends a bat meeting any one running away signifies an evasion for although she have no wings yet she flies a sparrow is a bad omen to one that runs away for she flies from the hawk and makes hast haste to the owl where she is in as great danger yet in love she is fortunate for being stirred up with lust couples seven times in an hour bees are a good omen to kings for they signifie an obsequious people flies signifie importunity and impudency because being oftentimes driven away they do yet continually return also domestick birds are not without some augurias for cocks by their crowing promote hope and the journey of him that is undertaking it moreover livia the mother of tiberius when she was great with him took a henegg and hatched it in her bosome and at length came forth a cock chick with a great comb which the augures interpreted that the child that should be born of her should be king and cicero writes that at thebais cocks by their crowing all night did presage that the btians would obtain victory against the lacedmonians and the reason is according to the augures interpretations because that bird when he is beaten is silent but when he himself hath overcome crows in like manner also omens of events are taken from beasts for the meeting of a weesel weasel is ominous also meeting of a hare is an ill omen to a traveller unless she be taken a mule also is bad because barren a hog is pernicious for such is his nature and therefore signifies pernicious men a horse betokens quarrellings and fightings whence anchises seeing of white horses cries out in virgil with war are horses armd yea threaten war but when they are joyned together in a chariot because they draw with an equall yoke they signifie that peace is to be hoped for an asse is an unprofitable creature yet did marius good who when he was pronounced an enemy to his country saw an asse disdaining provender that was offered to him and running to the water by which augury he supposing he saw a way of safety shewed to him intreated the aid of his friends that they would convey him to the sea which being granted he was set into a little ship and so escaped the threats of silla the conqueror if the foal of an asse meet any one going to an augury he signifies labor patience and hinderances a wolf meeting any one is a good sign the effect whereof was seen in hiero of sicilia from whom a wolf snatching away a book whilest he was at school confirmed to him the success of the kingdom but yet the wolf makes him speechless whom he sees first a wolf rent in pieces a watchman of p africanus and c fulvius at minturn when the romane army was overcome by the fugitives in sicilia also he signifies perfidious men such as you can give no credit to which was known in the progeny of romanes for the faith which they long since sucked from their mother the wolf and kept to themselves from the beginning as by a certain law of nature passed over to their posterity to meet a lion seeing she is amongst animals the strongest and striking terrour into all the rest is good but for a woman to meet a lionesse is bad because she hinders conception for a lionesse brings forth but once to meet sheep and goats is good it is read also in the ostentarian of the tuscians if this animall shall wear any unusuall colour it portends to the emperour plenty of all things together with much happiness whence virgil to pollio sings thus but in the meadows rams shall skarlet scarlet bear and changing sometimes golden fleeces wear it is good also to meet oxen treading out corn but better to meet them plowing which although breaking the way hinder thy journey yet by the favour of their auspicium will recompence thee again a dog in a journey is fortunate because cyrus being cast into the woods was nourished by a dog till he came to the kingdom which also the angel companion of tobit did not scorn as a companion the castor because he bites off his testicles and leaves them to the hunters is an ill omen and portends that a man will injure himself also amongst small animals mice signifie danger for the same day that they did gnaw gold in the capitoll both the consuls were intercepted by hannibal by way of ambush neer tarentum the locust making a stand in any place or burning the place hinders one from their wishes and is an ill omen on the contrary the grasshoppers grasshoppers promote a journey and foretell a good event of things the spider weaving a line downwards is said to signifie hope of money to come also the pismires ants because they know how to provide for themselves and to prepare safe nests for themselves portend security and riches a great army hence when the pismires ants had devoured a tame dragon of tiberius caesar it was advised that he should take heed of the tumult of a multitude if a snake meet thee take heed of an ill tongued enemy for this animall hath no power but in his mouth a snake creeping into tiberius his pallace palace portended his fall two snakes were found in the bed of sempronius gracchus wherefore a soothsayer told him if he would let the male or the female escape either he or his wife would shortly dye die he preferring the life of his wife killed the male and let the female escape and within a few dayes he dyed died so a viper signifies lewd women and wicked children and an eel signifies a man displeased with every body for she lives apart from all other fishes nor is ever found in the company of any but amongst all auspicias auguries and omens there is none more effectuall and potent then man none that doth signifie the truth more cleerly thou shalt therefore diligently note and observe the condition of the man that meeteth thee his age profession station gesture motion exercise complexion habit name words speech and all such like things for seeing there are in all other animals so many discoveries of presages without all question these are more efficacious and cleer which are infused into mans soul which tully cicero himself testifies saying that there is a certain auspicium naturally in mens souls of their eternity for the knowing of all the courses and causes of things in the foundation of the city of rome the head of a man was found with his whole face which did presage the greatness of the empire and gave the name to the mountain of the capitoll the brutian souldiers soldiers fighting against octavius and m antonius found an aethiopian ethiopian in the gate of their castle whom though they did slay as a presage of ill success yet they were unfortunate in the batle battle and brutus and cassius both generals were slain meeting of monks is commonly accounted an ill omen and so much the rather if it be early in the morning because these kind of men live for the most by the sudden death of men as vulturs vultures do by slaughters chapter lv how auspicas are verified by the light of naturall instinct and of some rules of finding of it out auspicia and auguria which foretell things to come by animals & birds orpheus the divine himself as we read did teach and shew first of all which afterwards were had in great esteem with all nations now they are verified by the light of naturall instinct as if from this some lights of divination may descend upon fourfooted beasts winged and other animals by which they are able to presage to us of the events of things which virgil seems to be sensible of when he sings nor think i heaven on them such knowledge states nor that their prudence is above the fates now this instinct of nature as saith william of paris is more sublime then all humane apprehension and very neer and most like to prophecy by this instinct there is a certain wonderfull light of divination in some animals naturally as it manifestly appears in some dogs who know by this instinct theeves thieves and men and finde them out and apprehend them falling upon them with a full mouth by the like instinct vulturs vultures foresee future slaughters in batles battles and gather together into places where they shall be as if they foresaw the flesh of dead carkases carcasses by the same instinct partridges partridges know their dam whichm they never saw and leave the partridge which stole away her dams eggs & sate upon them by the same instinct also certain hurtful and terrible things are perceived the soul of the men being altogether ignorant of them whence terror and horror ceaseth much upon men when they think nothing of these things so a thief lying hid in any house although no body knows or thinks of his being there strikes fear and terror and a troublesomeness of mind into the inhabitants of that house although haply not of all because the brightness of this instinct is not in all men yet of some of them so a harlot being hid in some very large house is sometimes perceived to be there by some one that is altogether ignorant of her being there it is mentioned in histories that heraiscus a certain egyptian a man of a divine nature could discern unclean women not only by his eyes but by their voice being heard afar off and thereupon did fall into a most grievous headach headache william of paris also makes mention of a certain woman in his time that by the same instinct perceived a man whom she loved coming two miles off also he relates that in his time was a certain stork convicted of unchastity by the smell of the male who being judged guilty by a multitude of storks whom the male gathered together discovering to them the fault of his mate was her feathers being pulled off torn in pieces by them he also makes mention of a certain horse who not knowing his dam mother and leaping of copulating with her when afterwards he understood what he had done bit off his own stones testicles by way of revenge upon himself for his incest the same doth varro aristotle and pliny relate concerning horses and pliny makes mention of a certain serpent called the asp that did such a like thing for she coming to a certain mans table in egypt was there daily fed and she having brought forth some young by one of which a son of her hosts was killed after she knew of it killed that young one and would never return to that house any more now by these examples you see how the lights of presage may descend upon some animals as signs or marks of things & are set in their gesture motion voice flying going meat colour and such like for according to the doctrine of the platonists there is a certain power put into inferiour things by which for the most part they agree with the superiours whence also the tacid consents of animals seem to agree with divine bodies and their bodies and affections to be affected with their powers by the name of which they are ascribed to the dieties deities we must consider therefore what animals are saturnall what are joviall and what martiall and so of the rest and according to their properties to draw forth their presages so those birds which resemble saturn and mars are all of them called terrible and deadly as the scritch screech owl the hawlet and others which we have mentioned before also the horn owl because she is a saturnall solitary bird also nightly and is reputed to be most unfortunately ominous of which the poet saith the ugly owl which no bird well resents fortels foretells misfortunes and most sad events but the swan is a delicious bird venereall and dedicated to phoebus and is said to be most happy in her presages especially in the auspicias of mariners because she is never drowned in water whence ovid sings most happy is the cheerfull singing swan in her presages there are also some birds that presage with their mouth and singing as the crow pie daw whence virgil this did foreshow oft from the hollow holm that ominous crow now the birds that portend future things by their flying are viz buzzards the bonebreakers eagles vulturs vultures cranes swans and the like for they are to be considered in their flying whether they fly slowly or swiftly whether to the right hand or to the left how many fly together upon this account if cranes fly apace they signifie a tempest when slowly fair weather also when two eagles fly together they are said to portend evill because that is a number of confusion in like manner thou shalt enquire into the reason of the rest as this is shewed of number moreover it belongs to an artist to observe a similitude in these conjectures as in virgil venus dissembling teacheth her son aeneas in these verses all this is not for naught else we in vain my parents augury taught lo twice six swans in a glad company joves bird pursued through the etheriall skie sky in heavens broad tracks now earth in a long train they seem to take or taken to disdain as they return with sounding wings they sport and heaven surrounding in a long consort just so i say thy friends and fleet have gaind the port or with full sailes the bay obtaind most wonderful is that kind of auguring of theirs who hear & understand the speeches of animals in which as amongst the ancients melampus and tiresias and thales and apollonius the tyanean apollonius of tyana who as we read excelled and whom they report had excellent skill in the language of birds of whom philostratus and porphyrius porphyry speak saying that of old when apollonius sate in company amongst his friends seeing sparrows sitting upon a tree and one sparrow coming from elsewhere unto them making a great chattering and noise and then flying away all the rest following him he said to his companions that that sparrow told the rest that an asse being burdened with wheat fell down in a hole neer the city and that the wheat was scattered upon the ground many being much moved with these words went to see and so it was as apollonius said at which they much wondered also porphyrius porphyry the platonist in his third book of sacrifices saith that there was a swallow for it was certain because every voice of any animall is significative of some passion of its soul as joy sadness or anger or the like which voices it is not so wonderfull a thing should be understood by men conversant about them but democritus himself declared this art as saith pliny by naming the birds of whose blood mixed together was produced a serpent of which whosoever did eat should understand the voices of birds and hermes saith if any one shall go forth to catch birds on a certain day of the kalends of november and shall boil the first bird which he catcheth with the heart of a fox that all that shall eat of this bird shall understand the voices of birds and all other animals also the arabians say that they can understand the meaning of bruits brutes who shall eat the heart and liver of dragons proclus also the platonist believed and wrote that the heart of a mole conduceth to presages there were also divinations and auspicias which were taken from the inwards of sacrifices the inventor whereof was tages of whom lucan sang and if the inwards have no credit gained and if this art by tages was but feigned the romane religion thought that the liver was the head of the inwards hence the soothsayers soothsayers enquiring after future things in the inwards did first look into the liver in which were two heads whereof the one was called the head for the city the other for the enemy and the heads of this or another part being compared together they pronounced victory as we read in lucan that the inwards did signifie the slaughter of pompeys men and the victory of caesars according to these verses i th inwards all defects are ominous on part and branch of th entrals entrails doth increase another part is weak and flagging lies beats and moves with quick pulse the arteries then the bowels being finished they search the heart now if there were a sacrifice found without an heart or a head was wanting in the liver these were deadly presages and were called piacularia also if a sacrifice fled from the altar or being smitten made a lowing or fell upon any part of his body then he ought to do it was the like ominous we read that when julius caesar on a day went forth to procession with his purple robe and sitting in a golden chair and sacrificing there was twice a heart wanting and when c marius utica was sacrificing there was wanting a liver also when caius the prince and m marcellus c claudius and l petellius coss were offering sacrifices that the liver was consumed away suddenly and not long after one of them dyed died of a disease another was slain by men of lyguria the entrals entrails foretelling so much which was thought to be done by the power of the gods or help of the divell devil hence it was accounted a thing of great concernment amongst the ancients as oft as any thing unusuall was found in the inwards as when sylla was sacrificing at laurentum the figure of a crown appeared in the head of the liver which posthumius the soothsayer interpreted to portend a victory with a kingdome and therefore advised that sylla should eat those entrals entrails himself the colour also of the inwards is to be considered of these lucan made mention struck at the colour prophets were with fear for with foul spots pale entrals entrails tinged were both black and blew blue with specks of sprinkled blood they were there was in times past such a venerable esteem of these arts that the most potent and wise men sought after them yea the senate and kings did nothing without the counsell of the augures but all these in these dayes partly by the negligence of men and partly by the authority of the fathers are abolished chapter lvi of the sooth sayings of flashes and lightenings and how monstrous and prodigious things are to be interpreted now the soothsayings of flashes and lightenings and of wonders and how monstrous and prodigious things are to be interpreted the prophets and priests of hetruscus have taught the art for they have ordained sixteen regions of the heavens and have ascribed gods to every one of them and besides eleven kinds of lightenings and nine gods which should dart them forth by shewing rules for understanding the signification of them but as often as monstrous prodigious and wondrous things happen they do presage as is most certain some great matter now their interpreter must be some excellent conjecturer of similitudes as also some curious searcher and of them who at that time are employed about the affairs of princes and provinces for the celestials take such care only for princes peoples and provinces that before the rest they might be prefigured and admonished by stars by constellations by wonders and by prodigies now if the same thing or the like hath been seen in former ages we must consider that very thing and what happened after that and according to these to fortell the same or the like because the same signs are for the same things and the like for like so prodigies have come before the birth and death of many eminent men and kings as cicero makes mention of midas a boy into whose mouth whilest he was sleeping the pismire ant put corns of wheat which was an omen of great riches so bees sate upon the mouth of plato when he was sleeping in the cradle by which was foretold the sweetness of his speech hecuba when she was bringing forth paris saw a burning torch which should set on fire troy and all asia there appeared unto the mother of phalaris the image of mercury pouring forth blood upon the earth with which the whole house was overflowed the mother of dionysius dreamed she brought forth a satyr which prodigious dreams the event that followed made good the wife of tarquinius priscus seeing a flame lick the head of servius tullius foretold that he should have the kingdom in like manner after troy was taken aeneas disputing with anchises his father concerning a flight there appeared a flame licking the crown of ascanius his head and doing of him no hurt which thing seeing it did portend the kingdom to ascanius perswaded him to depart for monstrous prodigies did forerun great and eminent destruction so we read in pliny that m attilius and c portius being consuls it rained milk and blood which did presage that a very great pestilence should the next yeer year overspread rome also in lucania it rained spongious spongeous iron & in the yeer before marcus crassus was slain in parthia with which also all the souldiers soldiers of lucania being a very numerous army were slain also l paulus and c marcellus being consuls it rained wool about the castle of corisanum neer which place a yeer year after t annius was slain by milus and in the wars of denmark the noise of arms and sound of a trumpet was heard in the aire and livie livy concerning the macedonian wars saith in the yeer when annibil annibal dyed died it rained blood for two dayes also concerning the second punick war he saith that water mixed with blood came down from heaven like rain at that time when annibal did spoil italy a little before the destruction of leuctra the lacedemonians heard a noise of arms in the temple of hercules and at the same time in the temple of hercules the doors that were shut with bars opened themselves and the arms that were hanged on the wall were found on the ground the like events may be prognosticated of other like things as oftentimes in times past something hath been foretold of them but concerning these also the judgements of the celestial influencies must not be neglected of which we shall more largely treat in the following chapters chapter lvii of geomancy hydromancy aeromancy pyromancy four divinations of elements moreover the elements themselves teach us fatall events whence those four famous kinds of divinations geomancy hydromancy aeromancy and pyromancy have got their names of which the sorceress in lucan seems to boast her self when she saith the earth the aire the chaos and the skie the seas the fields the rocks and mountains high foretell the truth the first therefore is geomancy whicb foresheweth future things by the motions of the earth as also the noise the swelling the trembling the chops the pits and exhalation and other impressions the art of which almadel the arabian sets forth but there is another kind of geomancy which divines by points written upon the earth by a certain power in the fall of it which is not of present speculation but of that we shall speak hereafter now hydromancy doth perform its presages by the impressions of water their ebbing and flowing their increases and depressions their tempests and colours and the like to which also are added visions which are made in the waters a kind of divination found by the persians as varro reports a boy saw in the water the effigies of mercury which foretold in an hundred and fifty verses all the events of mithridates his war we read also that numa pompilius practiced hydromancy for in the water he called up the gods and learned of them things to come which art also pythagoras a long time after numa practised there was of old a kind of hydromancy had in great esteem amongst the assyrians and it was called lecanomancy from a skin full of water upon which they put plates of gold and silver and pretious precious stones written upon with certain images names and characters to this may be referred that art by which lead and wax being melted and cast into the water do express manifest marks of images what we desire to know there were also in former years fountains that did foretell things to come as the fathersfountain at achaia and that which was called the water of juno in epidaurus but of these more in the following chapters where we shall speak of oracles hither also may be referred the divination of fishes of which kind there was use made by the lycians in a certain place which was called dina neer the sea in a wood dedicated to apollo made hollow in the dry sand into which he that went to consult of future things let down roasted meat and presently that place was filled with waters and a great multitude of fish and of strange shapes unknown to men did appear by the forms of which the prophet foretold what should come to pass these things doth atheneus more at large relate out of polycharmus in the history of the lycians after the same maner doth aeromancy divine by airy impressions by the blowing of the winds by rainbows by circles about the moon and stars by mists and clouds and by imaginations in clouds and visions in the aire so also pyromancy divines by fiery impressions and by stars with long tailes by fiery colours by visions and imaginations in the fire so the wife of cicero foretold that he would be consul the next year because when a certain man after the sacrifice was ended would look in the ashes there suddenly broke forth a flame of this kind are those that pliny speaks of that terrene pale and buzzing fires presage tempests circles about the snuffs of candles betoken rain if the flame fly turning and winding it portends wind also torches when they strike the fire before them and are not kindled also when a coal sticks to pots taken off from the fire and when the fire casts off the ashes and sparkles or when ashes are hard grown together on the hearth and when a coal is very bright to these is added capnomancy so called from smoak smoke because it searcheth into the flame and smoak smoke and thin colours sounds and motions when they are carryed upright or on one side or round which we read in these verses in statius let piety be bound and on th altar laid let us implore the gods for divine aid she makes acute red towring flames and bright increasd by th aire the middle being white and then she makes the flames without all bound for to wind in and out and to run round like to a serpent also in the aethnean caves and fields of the nymphs in apollonia auguries were taken from fires and flames joyful if they did receive what was cast into them and sad if they did reject them but of these things we shall speak in the following chapters amongst the answers of the oracles chapter lviii of the reviving of the dead and of sleeping and wanting victuals many years together the arabian philosophers agree that some men may elevate themselves above the powers of their body and above their sensitive powers and those being surmounted receive into themselves by the perfection of the heavens and intelligencies a divine vigour seeing therefore all the souls of men are perpetuall and also all the spirits obey the perfect souls magicians think that perfect men may by the powers of their soul repair their dying bodies with other inferiour souls newly separated and inspire them again as a weesell weasel that is killed is made alive again by the breath and cry of his dam mother and lions make alive their dead whelps by breathing upon them and because as they say all like things being applyed to their like are made of the same natures and every patient and thing that receives into it self the act of any agent is endowed with the nature of that agent and made connaturall hence they think that to this vivification or making alive some hearbs herbs and magicall confections such as they say are made of the ashes of the phoenix and the cast skin of a snake do much conduce which indeed to many seems fabulous and to some impossible unless it could be accounted approved by an historicall faith for we read of some that have been drowned in water others cast into the fire and put upon the fire others slain in war others otherwise tryed and after a few dayes were alive again as pliny testifies of aviola a man pertaining to the consull of l lamia cius tubero corfidius gabienus and many others also we read that aesop the talemaker tindoreus hercules and palicy the sons of jupiter and thalia being dead were raised to life again also that many were by physitians physicians and magicians raised from death again as the historians relate of aesculapius and we have above mentioned out of juba and xanthus and philostratus concerning tillo and a certain arabian and apollonius the tyanean also we read that glaucus a certain man that was dead whom they say beyond all expectation the physitians physicians coming to see it the hearb herb dragonwort restored to life some say that he revived by the puting into his body a medicine made of honey whence the proverb glaucus was raised from death by taking in honey into his body apuleius also relating the manner of these kinds of restorings to life saith of zachla the egyptian prophet the prophet being thus favourable layes a certain hearb herb upon the mouth of the body of a young man being dead and another upon his brest breast then turning towards the east or rising of the propitious sun praying silently a great assembly of people striving to see it in the first place heaved up his brest breast then makes a beating in his veines cpr then his body to be filled with breath mouthtomouth after which the carkase ariseth and the young man speaks if these things are true the dying souls must sometimes lying hid in their bodies be oppressed with vehement extasies ecstasies and be freed from all bodily action so that the life sense motion forsake the body and so that the man is not yet truly dead but lies astonied dazed and as it were dead for a certain time and this is often found that in times of pestilence many that are carried for dead to the graves to be buryed buried revive again the same also hath often befeln women by reason of fits of the mother and rabbi moises out of the book of galen which patriarcha translated makes mention of a man who was suffocated for six dayes and did neither eat nor drink and his arteries became hard and it is said in the same book that a certain man by being filled with water lost the pulse of his whole body so that the heart was not perceived to move and he lay like a dead man also it is said that a man by reason of a fal fall from a high place or great noise or long staying under the water may fall into a swoun swoon which may continue fourty eight fortyeight hours and so lye as if he were dead his face being very green and in the same place there is mention made of a man that buried a man that seemed to be dead seventy two hours after his seeming decease and so killed him because he buried him alive and there are given signs whereby it may be known who are alive although they seem to be dead and indeed will dye die unless there be some means used to recover them as phlebotomy or some other cure and these are such as very seldom happen this is the manner by which we understand magicians and physitians physicians do raise dead men to life as they that were tryed by the stinging of serpents were by the nation of the marsi and the psilli restored to life now we may conceive that such kind of extasies ecstasies may continue a long time although a man be not truly dead as it is in dormice dormice and crocodiles and many other serpents which sleep all winter and are in such a dead sleep that they can scarce be awakened with fire and i have often seen a dormouse dissected and continue immovable as if she were dead untill she was boyled boiled and when presently in boyling boiling the water the dissected members did shew life also although it be hard to be believed we read in some approved historians that some men have slept for many yeers together and in the time of sleep untill they awaked there was no alteration in them as to make them seem older the same doth pliny testifie of a certain boy whom he saith being wearied with heat and his journey slept fifty seven yeers in a cave we read also that epimenides gnosius slept fifty seven yeers in a cave hence the proverb arose to outsleep epimenides m damascenus tels that in his time a certain country man being wearied in germany slept for the space of a whole autumn and the winter following under a heap of hay untill the summer when the hay began to be eaten up then he was found awakened as a man halfe dead and out of his wits eclesiasticall ecclesiastical histories confirm this opinion concerning the seven sleepers whom they say slept yeers there was in norvegia a cave in a high sea shore where as paulus diaconus and methodius the martyr write seven men lay sleeping a long time without corruption and the people that went in to disturb them were contracted or drawn together so that after a while being forewarned by that punishment they durst not hurt them now xenocrates a man of no mean repute amongst philosophers was of opinion that this long sleeping was appointed by god as a punishment for some certain sins but marcus damascenus proves it by many reasons to be possible and naturall neither doth he think it irrationall that some should without meat and drink and avoyding excrements without consuming or corruption sleep many moneths and this may befall a man by reason of some poisonous potion or sleepy disease or such like causes for certain dayes moneths or years according to the intention or remission of the power of the medicine or of the passions of their mind and physitians physicians say that there are some antidotes of which they that take too great a potion shall be able to endure hunger a long time as elias in former time being fed with a certain food by an angell walked and fasted in the strength of that meat fourty forty dayes and john bocatius makes mention of a man in his time in venice who would every yeer fast four dayes without any meat but that was a greater wonder that there was a woman in lower germany at the same time who took no food till the thirteenth yeer of her age which to us may seem incredible but that he lately confirmed it as also he tels of a miracle of our age that his brother nicolaus stone an helvetian by nation who lived twenty yeers in the wilderness without meat till he dyed died that also is wonderfull which theophrastus mentions concerning a certain man called philinus who used no meat or drink besides milk and there are grave authors who describe a certain hearb herb of sparta with which they say the scythians can endure twelve dayes hunger without meat or drink if they do but tast taste it or hold it in their mouth chapter lix of divination by dreams there is also a certain kind of divination by dreams confirmed by the traditions of philosophers the authorities of divines the examples of histories and daily experience a dreams i call here not vain dreams or idle imaginations for those are vain and have no divination in them but arise from the remains of watchings and disturbance of the body for as the mind is taken up about and wearied with cares it suggests it self to him that is asleep i call that a dream here which is caused by the celestiall influences in the phantastick spirit mind or body being all well disposed the rule of interpreting this is found amongst astrologers in that part which is wrote concerning questions but yet that is not sufficient because these kind of dreams come by use to divers men after a divers manner and according to the divers quality and dispositions of the phantastick spirit wherefore there cannot be given one common rule to all for the interpretation of dreams but according to the opinion of synesius seeing there are the same accidents to things and like befall like so be which hath often fallen upon the same visible thing hath assigned to himself the same opinion passion fortune action event and as aristotle saith the memory is confirmed by sence sense and by keeping in memory the same thing knowledge is obtained as also by the knowledge of many experiences by little & little arts and sciences are obtained after the same account you must conceive of dreams whence synesius commands that every one should observe his dreams and their events and such like rules viz to commit to memory all things that are seen and accidents that befall as well in sleep as in watching and with a diligent observation consider with himself the rules by which these are to be examined for by this means shall a diviner be able by little and little to interpret his dreams if so be nothing slip out of his memory now dreams are more efficacious when the moon overruns that sign which was in the ninth number of the nativity or revolution of that yeer or in the ninth sign from the sign of perfection for it is a most true and certain divination neither doth it proceed from nature or humane arts but from purified minds by divine inspiration we shall now discuss and examine that which belongs to prophecyings and oracles efficaciora autem sunt somnia quando luna illud percurrit signum quod fuit in nona radicis nativitatis vel revolutionis illius anni vel in nono signo a signo profectionis chapter lx of madness and divinations which are made when men are awake and of the power of a melancholy humor by which spirits are sometimes induced into mens bodies it happens also sometimes that not only they that are asleep but also they that are watchfull do with a kind of instigation of minde divine which divination aristotle cals ravishment or a kind of madness and teacheth that it proceeds from a melancholy humor saying in his treatise of divination melancholy men by reason of their earnestness do far better conjecture and quickly conceive a habit and most easily receive an impression of the celestials and in his problemes saith that the sibyls and the bacchides and niceratus the syracusan and amon were by their naturall melancholy complexion prophets and poets the cause therefore of this madness if it be any thing within the body is a melancholy humor not that which they call black choller choler which is so obstinate and terrible a thing that the violence of it is said by physitians physicians and naturall phylosophers philosophers besides madness which it doth induce also to entice evill spirits to seize upon mens bodies therefore we understand a melancholy humor here to be a naturall and white choller choler for this when it is stirred up burns and stirs up a madness conducing to knowledge and divination especially if it be helped by any celestiall influx especially of saturn who seeing he is cold and dry as is a melancholy humor hath his influence upon it increaseth and preserveth it besides seeing he is the author of secret contemplation and estranged from all publike public affairs and the highest of all the planets doth alwaies as with call his mind from outward businesses so also makes it ascend higher and bestows upon him the knowledge and passages of future things and this is aristotles meaning in his book of problemes by melancholy saith he some men are made as it were divine foretelling things to come and some men are made poets he saith also that all men that were excellent in any science were for the most part melancholy democritus and plato attest the same saying that there were some melancholy men that had such excellent wits that they were thought and seemed to be more divine then humane so also there have been many melancholy men at first rude ignorant and untractable as they say hesiod ion tynnichus calcinenses homer and lucretius were who on a suddain were taken with a madness and became poets and prophecied wonderfull and divine things which they themselves scarce understood whence divine plato in ion saith many prophets after the violence of their madness was abated do not well understand what they wrote yet treated acurately accurately of each art in their madness as all artists by reading of them judge so great also they say the power of melancholy is of that by its force celestiall spirits also are sometimes drawn into mens bodies by whose presence and instinct antiquity testifies men have been made drunk and spake most wonderful things and that they think happens under a threefold threefold difference according to a threefold apprehension of the soul viz imaginative rationall and mentall they say therefore when the mind is forced with a melancholy humor nothing moderating the power of the body and passing beyond the bonds of the members is wholly carried into imagination and doth suddenly become a seat for inferior spirits by whom it oftentimes receives wonderfull wayes and forms of manuall arts so we see that any most ignorant man doth presently become an excellent painter or contrivers of building and to become a master in any such art but when these kinds of spirits portend to us future things they shew those things which belong to the disturbing of the elements and changes of times as rain tempests innundations earthquakes great mortality famine slaughter and the like as we read in aulus gelius that cornelius patarus his priest did at the time when cesar and pompey were to fight in thessalia being taken with a madness foretell the time order and issue of the battell battle but when the mind is turned wholly into reason it becomes a receptacle for midle middle spirits hence it obtains the knowledge and understanding of natural and humane things so we see that a man sometimes doth on a suddain become a philosopher physitian physician or an excellent orator and foretels foretells mutations of kingdomes and restitutions of ages and such things as belong to them as the sybill sibyl did to the romanes but when the mind is wholly elevated into the understanding then it becomes a receptacle of sublime spirits and learns of them the secrets of divine things such as the law of god the orders of angels and such things as belong to the knowledge of things eternall and salvation of souls it foresees things which are appointed by gods speciall predestination as future prodigies or miracles the prophet to come and the changing of the law so the sybills sibyls prophecyed of christ a long time before his coming so virgil understanding that christ was at hand and remembring what the sybill sibyl cumaea had said sang thus to pollio last times are come cumas prophesie now from high heaven springs a new progenie and times great order now again is born the maid returns saturnian realms return and a little after intimating that originall sin shall be of no effect saith if any prints of our old vice remaind by thee theyr voyd and fear shall leave the land he a gods life shall take with gods shall see mixt heroes and himself their object be rule with paternall power th appeased earth he shall then he adds that thence the fall of the serpent and the poison of the tree of death or of the knowledge of good and evill shall be nulled saying the serpent shall and the deceitfull hearb herb of venome fall yet he intimates that some sparks of originall sin shall remain when he saith some steps of ancient fraud shall yet be found and at last with a most great hyperbole cryes out to his child as the offspring offspring of god adoring him in these words dear race of gods great stock of jupiter behold the world shakes on its ponderous axe see earth and heavens immense and th ocean tracts how all things at th approaching age rejoyce oh that my life would last so long and voyce as would suffice thy actions to rehearse there are also some prognosticks which are in the midle middle betwixt naturall and supernaturall divination as in those who are neer to death and being weakened with old age do sometimes foresee things to come because as saith plato by how much the more men are less hindred by their sence so much the more acurately they understand and because they are neerer to the place whither they must go and their bonds being as it were a little loosed seeing they are no more subject to the body easily perceive the light of divine revelation chapter lxi of the forming of man of the external senses and also the inward and the mind of the threefold appetite of the soul and passions of the will it is the opinion of some divines that god did not immediately creat create the body of man but by the assistance of the heavenly spirits compound and frame him which opinion alchinous and plato favor thinking that god is the chief creator of the whole world of spirits both good and bad and therefore immortalized them but that all kinds of mortall animals were made at the command of god for if he should have created them they must have been immortall the spirits therefore mixing earth fire aire and water together made of them all put together one body which they subjected to the service of the soul assigning in it severall provinces to each power thereof to the meaner of them mean and low places as to anger the midriff to lust the womb but to the more noble senses the head as the tower of the whole body and then the manifold organs of speech they divide the sense into external and internall the externall are divided into five known to every one to which there are allotted five organs or subjects as it were foundations being so ordered that they which are placed in the more eminent part of the body have a greater degree of purity for the eyes placed in the uppermost place are the most pure and have an affinity with the nature of fire and light then the ears have the second order of place and purity and are compared to the aire the nostrils have the third order and have a middle nature betwixt the aire and the water then the organ of tasting which is grosser and most like to the nature of water last of all the touching is diffused through the whole body and is compared to the grossness of earth the more pure senses are those which perceive their objects farthest off as seeing and hearing then the smelling then the tast taste which doth not perceive but those that are nigh but the touch perceives both wayes for it perceives bodies nigh and as sight discerns by the medium of the aire so the touch perceives by the medium of a stick or pole bodies hard soft and moist now the touch only is common to all animals for it is most certain that man hath this sense and in this and tast taste he excels all other animals but in the other three he is excelled by some animals as by a dog who hears sees and smels smells more acutely then man and the linx lynx and eagles see more acutely then all other animals & man now the interior senses are according to averrois divided into four whereof the first is called common sence sense because it doth first collect and perfect all the representations which are drawn in by the outward senses the second is the imaginative power whose office is seeing it represents nothing to retain those representations which are received by the former senses and to present them to the third faculty of inward sense which is the phantasie or power of judging whose work is also to perceive and judge by the representations received what or what kind of thing that is of which the representations are and to commit those things which are thus discerned and adjudged to the memory to be kept for the vertues thereof in generall are discourse dispositions persecutions and flights and stirrings up to action but in particular the understanding of intellectuals vertues the manner of discipline counsel election and this is that which shews us future things by dreams whence the fancy is sometimes named the phantasticall intellect for it is the last impression of the understanding which as saith iamblicus is belonging to all the powers of the mind and forms all figures resemblances of species and operations and things seen and sends forth the impressions of other powers unto others and those things which appear by sence sense it stirs up into an opinion but those things which appear by the intellect in the second place it offers to opinion but of it self it receives images from all and by its property doth properly assign them according to their assimilation forms all the actions of the soul and accommodates the externall to the internall and impresses the body with its impression now these senses have their organs in the head for the common sence sense and imagination take up the two former cels cells of the brain although aristotle placeth the organ of the common sence sense in the heart but the cogitative power possesseth the highest and middle part of the head and lastly the memory the hinmost part thereof moreover the organs of voice and speech are many as the inward muscles of the breast betwixt the ribs the breasts the lungs the arteries the windpipe the bowing of the tongue and all those parts and muscles that serve for breathing but the proper organ of speech is the mouth in which are framed words and speeches the tongue the teeth the lips the palate &c above the sensible soul which expresseth its powers by the organs of the body the incorporeall mind possesseth the highest place and it hath a double nature the one which inquireth into the causes properties and progress of those things which are contained in the order of nature and is content in the contemplation of the truth which is therefore called the contemplative intellect the other is a power of the mind which discerning by consulting what things are to be done and what things to be shunned is wholly taken up in consultation and action and is therefore ealled the active intellect this order of powers therefore nature ordained in man that by the externall sences senses we might know corporeall things by the internall the representations of bodies as also things abstracted by the mind and intellect which are neither bodies nor any thing like them and according to this threefold order of the powers of the soul there are three appetites in the soul the first is naturall which is an inclination of nature into its end as of a stone downward which is in all stones another is animal which the sense follows and it is divided into irascible and concupiscible the third is intellective which is called the will differing from the sensitive in this the sensitive is of it self of those things which may be presented to the senses desiring nothing unless in some manner comprehended but the will although it be of it self of all things that are possible yet because it is free by its essence it may be also of things that are impossible as it was in the devil desiring himself to be equall with god and therefore is altered and depraved with pleasure and continuall anguish whilest it assents to the inferiour powers whence from its depraved appetite there arise four passions in it with which in like manner the body is affected sometimes whereof the first is called oblectation which is a certain quietness or assentation of the mind or will because it obeys and not willingly consents to that pleasantness which the senses hold forth which is therefore defined to be an inclination of the mind to an effeminate pleasure the second is called effusion which is a remission of or dissolution of the power viz when beyond the oblectation the whole power of the mind and intention of the present good is melted and diffuseth it self to enjoy it the third is vaunting and loftiness thinking it self to have attained to some great good in the enjoyment of which it prides it self and glorieth the fourth and the last is envy or a certain kind of pleasure or delight at another mans harm without any advantage to it self it is said to be without any advantage to it self because if any one should for his own profit rejoyce at an other mans harm this would be rather out of love to himself then out of ill wil will to another and these four passions arising from a depraved appetite for pleasure the grief or perplexity it self doth also beget so many contrary passions as horror sadness fear and sorrow at anothers good without his own hurt which we call envy ie sadness at anothers prosperity as pity is a certain kind of sadness at anothers misery chapter lxii of the passions of the mind their original origin difference and kinds the passions of the mind are nothing else but certain motions or inclinations proceeding from the apprehension of any thing as of good or evill convenient or inconvenient now these kind of apprehensions are of three sorts viz sensual rationall and intellectuall and according to these three are three sorts of passions in the soul for when they follow the sensitive apprehension then they respect a temporall good or evill under the notion of profitable or unprofitable delightfull and offensive and are called naturall or animall passions when they follow the rational apprehension and so respect good or bad under the notions of vertue or vice praise or disgrace profitable or unprofitable honest or dishonest they are called rationall or voluntary passions when they follow the intellectuall apprehension and respect good or bad under the notion of just or unjust true or false they are called intellectuall passions or synderesis now the subject of the passions of the soul is the concupitive power of the soul and is divided into concupiscible and irascible and both respect good and bad but under a different notion for when the concupiscible power respects good and evil absolutely love or lust or on the contrary hatred is caused when it respects good as absent so desire is caused or evill as absent or at hand and so is caused horror flying from or loathing or if it respect good as present then there is caused delight mirth or pleasure but if evill as present then sadness anxiety grief but the irascible power respects good or bad under the notion of some difficulty to obtain the one or avoid the other and this sometimes with confidence and so there is caused hope or boldness but when with diffidency then despair and fear but when that irascible power riseth into revenge and this be onely about some evill past as it were of injury or hurt offered there is caused anger and so we find eleven passions in the mind which are love hatred desire horror joy grief hope despair boldness fear and anger chapter lxiii how the passions of the mind change the proper body by changing the accidents and moving the spirit the phantasie or imaginative power hath a ruling power over the passions of the soul when they follow the sensuall apprehension for this doth of its own power according to the diversity of the passions first of all change the proper body with a sensible transmutation by changing the accidents in the body and by moving the spirit upward or downward inward or outward and by producing divers qualities in the members so in joy the spirits are driven outward in fear drawn back in bashfulness are moved to the brain so in joy the heart is dilated outward by little and little in sadness is constringed by little and little inward after the same manner in anger or fear but suddenly again anger or desire of revenge produceth heat redness a bitter tast taste and a looseness fear induceth cold trembling of the heart speechlessness and paleness sadness causeth sweat and a blewish bluish whiteness pitty pity which is a kind of sadness doth often ill affect the body of him that takes pitty pity that it seems to be the body of another man affected also it is manifest that amongst some lovers there is such a strong tye tie of love that what the one suffers the other suffers anxiety induceth dryness and blackness and how great heats love stirs up in the liver and pulse physitians physicians know discerning by that kind of judgement the name of her that is beloved in an heroick passion so naustratus knew that antiochus was taken with the love of stratonica it is also manifest that such like passions when they are most vehement may cause death and this is manifest to all men that with too much joy sadness love hatred men many times dye die and are sometimes freed from a disease so we read that sophocles and dionysius the sicilian tyrant did both suddenly dye die at the news of a tragicall victory so a certain woman seeing her son returning from the canensian battle dyed died suddenly now what sadness can do is known to all we know that dogs oftentimes dye die with sadness for the death of their masters sometimes also by reason of these like passions long diseases follow and are sometimes cured so also some men looking from an high place by reason of great fear tremble are dimsighted and weakened and sometimes loose their senses so fears and fallingsickness sometimes follow sobbing sometimes wonderfull effects are produced as in the son of crsus whom his mother brought forth dumb yet a vehement fear and ardent affection made him speak which naturally he could never do so with a suddain fall oftentimes life sense or motion on a suddain leave the members and presently again are sometimes returned and how much vehement anger joyned with great audacity can do alexander the great shews who being circumvented with a battle in india was seen to send forth from himself lightening lightning and fire the father of theodoricus is said to have sent forth out of his body sparks of fire so that sparkling flames did leap out with a noyse noise and such like things sometimes appear in beasts as in tiberius his horse which is said to send forth a flame out of his mouth chapter lxiv how the passions of the mind change the body by way of imitation from some resemblance also of the transforming and translating of men and what force the imaginative power hath not only over the body but the soul the foresaid passions sometimes alter the body by way of imitation the reason of the vertue which the likeness of the thing hath to change it which power the vehement imagination moves as in setting the teeth on edge at the sight or hearing of something or because we see or imagine another to eat sharp or soure things so he which sees another gape yawn gapes also and some when they hear any one name soure things their tongues waxeth tart also the seeing of any filthy thing causeth nauseousness many at the sight of mans blood fall into a swoun swoon some when they see bitter meat given to any perceive a bitter spitle spittle in their mouth and william of paris saith that he saw a man that at the sight of a medicine went to stool as oft as he pleased when as neither the substance of the medicine nor the odour nor the tast taste of it came to him but only a kind of resemblance was apprehended by him upon this account some that are in a dream think they burn and are in a fire and are fearfully tormented as if they did truly burn when as the substance of the fire is not neer them but only a resemblance apprehended by their imagination and sometimes mens bodies are transformed and transfigured and also transported and this ofttimes when they are in a dream and sometimes when they are awake so cyprus after he was chosen king of italy did very much wonder at and meditate upon the sight fight and victory of buls bulls and in the thought thereof did sleep a whole night but in the morning was found horned no otherwise then by the vegetative power being stirred up by a vehement imagination elevating corniferous humors into his head and producing horns for a vehement cogitation whilest it vehemently moves the species pictures out the figure of the thing thought on which they represent in their blood and the blood impresseth from it self on the members that are nourished by it as upon those of the same body so upon those of anothers as the imagination of a woman with child impresseth the mark of the thing longed for upon her infant and the imagination of a man bit with a mad dog impresseth upon his urine the image of dogs so men may grow grey on a suddain and some by the dream of one night have grown up from boies boys into perfect men hitherto may be referred those many scarrs of king dagobertus and marks of franciscus which they received the one whilest he was afraid of correction the other whilest he did wonderfully meditate upon the wounds of christ so many are transported from place to place passing over rivers fires and unpassable places viz when the species of any vehement desire or fear or boldness are impressed upon their spirits and being mixed with vapors do move the organ of the touch in their original together with phantasie which is the original of locall motion whence they stir up the members and organs of motion to motion and are moved without any mistake unto the imagined place not out of sight but from the interiour fantasy phantasy so great a power is there of the soul upon the body that which way soever that imagines and dreams that it goes thither doth it lead the body we read many other examples by which the power of the soul upon the body is wonderfully explained as is that which avicen describes of a certain man who when he pleased could affect his body with the palsie palsy they report of gallus vibius that he did fall into madness not casually but on purpose for whilest he did imitate mad men he assimilated their madness to himself and became mad indeed and austin augustine makes mention of some men who would move their ears at their pleasure and some that would move the crown of their head to their forehead and could draw it back again when they pleased and of another that could sweat at his pleasure and it is well known that some can weep at their pleasure and pour forth abundance of tears and that there are some that can bring up what they have swallowed when they please as out of a bag by degrees and we see that in these dayes there are many who can so imitate and express the voices of birds cattle dogs and some men that they can scarce at all be discerned also pliny relates by divers examples that women have been turned into men pontanus testifieth that in his time a certain woman called caietava and another called aemilia who after many years after they were married were changed into men now how much imagination can do upon the soul no man is ignorant for it is neerer to the substance of the soul then the sense is wherefore it acts more upon the soul then the sense doth so women by certain strong imaginations dreams and suggestions brought in by certain magicall arts do oftentimes bind them into a strong loving of any one so they say that medea only by a dream burnt in love towards jason so the soul sometimes is by a vehement imagination or speculation altogether abstracted from the body as celsus relates of a certain presbyter who as oft as he pleased could make himself senseless and lie like a dead man that when any one pricked or burnt him he felt no pain but lay without any motion or breathing yet he could as he said hear mens voices as it were afar off if they cryed out aloud but of these abstractions we shall discourse more fully in the following chapters chapter lxv how the passions of the mind can work out of themselves upon anothers body the passions of the soul which follow the phantasie when they are most vehement cannot only change their own body but also can transcend so as to work upon another body so that some wonderfull impressions are thence produced in elements and extrinsecall things and also can so take away or bring some disease of the mind or body for the passions of the soul are the chiefest cause of the temperament of its proper body so the soul being strongly elevated and inflamed with a strong imagination sends forth health or sickness not only in its proper body but also in other bodies so avicen is of the opinion that a camell may fall by the imagination of any one so he which is bitten with a mad dog presently fals into a madness and there appear in his urine the shapes of dogs so the longing of a woman with child doth act upon anothers body when it signs the infant in the womb with the mark of the thing longed for so many monstrous generations proceed from monstrous imaginations of women with child as marcus damascenus reports that at petra sancta a town scituated situated upon the territories of pisa viz a wench that was presented to charls charles king of bohemia who was rough and hairy all over her body like a wild beast whom her mother affected with a religious kind of horrour horror upon the picture of john baptist which was by her bed in time of conception afterwards brought forth after this fashion and this we see is not only in men but also is done amongst bruit brute creatures so we read that jacob the patriarch with his speckled rods set in the watering places did discolour the sheep of laban so the imaginative powers of peacocks and other birds whilest they be coupling impress a colour upon their wings whence we produce white peacocks peacocks by hanging round the places where they couple with white clothes now by these examples it appears how the affection of the phantasie when it vehemently intends it self doth not only affect its own proper body but also anothers so also the desire of witches to hurt doth bewitch men most perniciously with stedfast steadfast lookes to these things avicen aristotle algazel and gallen assent for it is manifest that a body may most easily be affected with the vapour of anothers diseased body which we plainly see in the plague and leprosie leprosy again in the vapours of the eyes there is so great a power that they can bewitch and infect any that are near them as the cockatrice or basilisk killing men with their looks and certain women in scythia amongst the illyrians and triballi killed whomsoever they looked angry upon therefore let no man wonder that the body and soul of one may in like manner be affected with the mind of another seeing the mind is far more powerfull strong fervent and more prevalent in its motion then vapours exhaling out of bodies neither are there wanting mediums by which it should work neither is anothers body less subjected to anothers mind then to anothers body upon this account they say that a man by him affection and habit only may act upon another therefore philosophers advise that the society of evill and mischievous men must be shunned for their soul being full of noxious rayes infects them that are near with a hurtfull contagion on the contrary they advise that the society of good and fortunate men be endeavored after because by their nearness they do us much good for as the smell of assafetida asafetida or musk so of bad something of bad of good something of good is derived upon them that are nigh and sometimes continues a long time now then if the foresaid passions have so great a power in the phantasie they have certainly a greater power in the reason in as much as the reason is more excellent then the phantasie and lastly they have much greater power in the mind for this when it is fixt upon god for any good with its whole intention doth oftentimes affect anothers body as well as its own with some divine gift by this means we read that many miracles were done by apollonius pythagoras empedocles philolaus and many prophets and holy men of our religion but of these more fully in the following chapters where we shall discourse of religion chapter lxvi that the passions of the mind are helped by a celestiall season and how necessary the constancy of the mind is in every work the passions of the mind are much helped and are helpfull and become most powerfull by vertue of the heaven as they agree with the heaven either by any naturall agreement or by voluntary election for as saith ptolomeus ptolomy he which chooseth that which is the better seems to differ nothing from him who hath this of nature it conduceth therefore very much for the receiving of the benefit of the heavens in any work if we shall by the heaven make our selves sutable suitable to it in our thoughts affections imaginations elections deliberations contemplations and the like for such like passions do vehemently stir up our spirit to their likeness and suddenly expose us and ours to the superior significators of such like passions and also by reason of their dignity and neerness to the superiors do much more partake of the celestials then any materiall things for our mind can through imaginations or reason by a kind of imitation be so conformed to any star as suddenly to be filled with the vertues of that star as if it were a proper receptacle of the influence thereof now the contemplating mind as it withdraws it self from all sense imagination nature and deliberation and cals calls it self back to things separated unless it exposeth it self to saturn is not of present consideration or enquiry for our mind doth effect divers things by faith which is a firm adhesion a fixt intention and a vehement application of the worker or receiver to him that cooperates in any thing and gives power to the work which we intend to do so that there is made as it were in us the image of the vertue to be received and the thing to be done in us or by us we must therefore in every work and application of things affect vehemently imagine hope and believe strongly for that will be a great help and it is verified amongst physitians physicians that a strong belief and an undoubted hope and love towards the physitian physician and medicine conduce much to health yea more sometimes than the medicine it self for the same that the efficacy and vertue of the medicine works the same doth the strong imagination of the physitian physician work being able to change the qualities in the body of the sick especially when the patient placeth much confidence in the physitian physician by that means disposing himself for the receiving of the vertue of the physitian physician and physick medicine therefore he that works in magick must be of a constant belief be credulous and not at all doubt of obtaining the effect for as a firm and strong belief doth work wonderfull things although it be in false works so distrust and doubting doth dissipate and break the vertu vertue of the mind of the worker which is the medium betwixt both extreams whence it happens that he is frustrated of the desired influence of the superiors which could not be joyned and united to our labours without a firm and solid vertue of our mind chapter lxvii how mans mind may be joyned with the mind and intelligencies of the celestials and together with them impress certain wonderfull vertues upon inferiour things the philosophers especially the arabians say that mans mind when it is most intent upon any work through its passion and effects is joyned with the mind of the stars and intelligencies and being so joyned is the cause of some wonderfull vertue be infused into our works and things and this as because there is in it an apprehension and power of all things so because all things have a naturall obedience to it and of necessity an efficacy and more to that which desires them with a strong desire and according to this is verified the art of characters images inchantments enchantments and some speeches and many other wonderfull experiments to every thing which the mind affects by this means whatsoever the mind of him that is in vehement love affects hath an efficacy to cause love & whatsoever the mind of him that strongly hates dictates hath an efficacy to hurt and destroy the like is in other things which the mind affects with a strong desire for all those things which the mind acts and dictates by characters figures words speeches gestures and the like help the appetite of the soul and acquire certain wonderfull vertues as from the soul of the operator in that hour when such a like appetite doth invade it so from the opportunity and celestiall influence moving the mind in that manner for our mind when it is carried upon the great excess of any passion or vertue oftentimes presently takes of it self a strong better and more convenient hour or opportunity which thomas aquinas in his third book against the gentiles confesseth so many wonderfull vertues both cause and follow certain admirable operations by great affections in those things which the soul doth dictate in that hour to them but know that such kind of things confer nothing or very little but to the author of them and to him which is inclined to them as if he were the author of them and this is the manner by which their efficacy is found out and it is a generall rule in them that every mind that is more excellent in its desire and affection makes such like things more fit for it self as also efficatious to that which it desires every one therefore that is willing to work in magick must know the vertue measure order and degree of his own soul in the power of the universe chapter lxviii how our mind can change and bind inferiour things to that which it desires there is also a certain vertue in the minds of men of changing attracting hindring and binding to that which they desire and all things obey them when they are carried into a great excess of any passion or vertu vertue so as to exceed those things which they bind for the superior binds that which is inferior and converts it to it self and the inferior is by the same reason converted to the superior or is otherwise affected and wrought upon by this reason things that receive a superior degree of any star bind or attract or hinder things which have an inferior according as they agree or disagree amongst themselves whence a lion is afraid of a cock because the presence of the solary vertue is more agreeable to a cock then to a lion so a loadstone draws iron because in order it hath a superior degree of the celestiall bear so the diamond hinders the loadstone because in the order of mars it is superior to it in like manner any man when he is opportunely exposed to the celestiall influencies as by the affections of his mind so by the due applications of naturall things if he become stronger in a solary vertue binds and draws the inferior into admiration and obedience in order of the moon to servitude or infirmities in a saturnall order to quietness or sadness in order of jupiter to worship in order of mars to fear and discord in order of venus to love and joy in a mercuriall order to perswasion persuasion and obsequiousness and the like now the ground of such a kind of binding is the very vehement and boundless affection of the souls with the concourse of the celestiall order but the dissolutions or hinderances of such a like binding are made by a contrary effect and that more excellent or strong for as the greater excess of the mind binds so also it looseth and hindreth and lastly when the thou fearest venus oppose saturn when saturn or mars oppose venus or jupiter for astrologers say that these are most at enmity and contrary the one to the other ie causing contrary effects in these inferior bodies for in the heaven where there is nothing wanting and where all things are governed with love there can in no wise be hatred or enmity chapter lxix of speech and the vertue of words it being shewed that there is a great power in the affections of the soul you must know moreover that there is no less vertue in words and the names of things but greatest of all in speeches and motions by which we chiefly differ from bruits brutes and are called rationall not from reason which is taken for that part of the soul which contains the affections which galen saith is also common to bruits brutes although in a less degree but we are called rationall from that reason which is according to the voice understood in words and speech which is called declarative reason by which part we do chiefly excell all other animals for logov logos in greek signifies reason speech and a word now a word is twofold viz internall and uttered an internall word is a conception of the mind and motion of the soul which is made without a voice as in dreams we seem to speak and dispute with our selves and whilest we are awake we run over a whole speech silently but an uttered word hath a certain act in the voice and properties of locution and is brought forth with the breath of a man with opening of his mouth and with the speech of his tongue in which nature hath coupled the corporeall voice and speech to the mind and understanding making that a declarer and interpreter of the conception of our intellect to the hearers and of this we now speak words therefore are the fittest medium betwixt the speaker and the hearer carrying with them not only the conception of the mind but also the vertue of the speaker with a certain efficacy unto the hearers and this oftentimes with so great a power that oftentimes they change not only the hearers but also other bodies and things that have no life now those words are of greater efficacy then others which represent greater things as intellectuall celestiall and supernaturall as more expressly so more misteriously mysteriously also those that come from a more worthy tongue or from any of a more holy order for these as it were certain signs and representations receive a power of celestiall and supercelestiall things as from the vertue of things explained of which they are the vehicula so from a power put into them by the vertue of the speaker chapter lxx of the vertue of proper names that proper names of things are very necessary in magicall operations almost all men testifie for the naturall power of things proceeds first from the objects to the senses and then from these to the imagination and from this to the mind in which it is first conceived and then is expressed by voices and words the platonists therefore say that in this very voice or word or name framed with its articles that the power of the thing as it were some kind of life lies under the form of the signification first conceived in the mind as it were through certain seeds of things then by voices or words as a birth brought forth and lastly kept in writings hence magicians say that proper names of things are certain rayes of things every where present at all times keeping the power of things as the essence of the thing signified rules and is discerned in them and know the things by them as by proper and living images for as the great operator doth produce divers species and particular things by the influencies of the heavens and by the elements together with the vertues of planets so according to the properties of the influencies proper names result to things and are put upon them by him who numbers the multitude of the stars calling them all by their names of which names christ in another place speaks saying your names are written in heaven adam therefore that gave the first names to things knowing the influencies of the heavens and properties of all things gave them all names according to their natures as it is written in genesis where god brought all things that he had created before adam that he should name them and as he named any thing so the name of it was which names indeed contain in them wonderfull powers of the things signified every voice therefore that is significative first of all signifies by the influence of the celestiall harmony secondly by the imposition of man although oftentimes otherwise by this then by that but when both significations meet in any voice or name which are put upon them by the said harmony or men then that name is with a double vertue viz naturall and arbitrary made most efficatious to act as oft as it shall be uttered in due place and time and seriously with an intention exercised upon the matter rightly disposed and that can naturally be acted upon by it so we read in philostratus that when a maid at rome dyed died the same day she was married and was presented to apollonius he accurately inquired into her name which being known he pronounced some occult thing by which she revived it was an observation amongst the romanes in their holy rites that when they did besiege any city they did diligently enquire into the proper and true name of it and the name of that god under whose protection it was which being known they did then with some verse call forth the gods that were the protectors of that city and did curse the inhabitants of that city so at length their gods being absent did overcome them as virgil sings that kept this realm our gods their altars have forsook and blest abodes now the verse with which the gods were called out and the enemies were curst cursed when the city was assaulted round about let him that would know finde it out in livy and macrobius but also many of these serenus samonicus in his book of secret things makes mention of chapter lxxi of many words joyned together as in sentences and verses and of the vertues and astrictions of charms besides the vertues of words and names there is also a greater vertue found in sentences from the truth contained in them which hath a very great power of impressing changing binding and establishing so that being used it doth shine the more and being resisted is more confirmed and consolidated which vertue is not in simple words but in sentences by which any thing is affirmed or denyed of which sort are verses enchantments imprecations deprecations orations invocations obtestations adjurations conjurations and such like therefore in composing verses and orations for attracting the vertue of any star or deity you must diligently consider what vertues any star contains as also what effects and operations and to infer them in verses by praising extolling amplifying and setting forth those things which such a kind of star is wont to cause by way of its influence and by vilifying and dispraising those things which it is wont to destroy and hinder and by supplicating and begging for that which we desire to get and by condemning and detesting that which we would have destroyed & hindered and after the same manner to make an elegant oration and duly distinct by articles with competent numbers and proportions moreover magicians command that we call upon and pray by the names of the same star or name to them to whom such a verse belongs by their wonderfull things or miracles by their courses and waies in their sphear sphere by their light by the dignity of their kingdome by the beauty and brightness that is in it by their strong and powerfull vertues and by such like as these as psyche in apuleius prayes to ceres saying i beseech thee by thy fruitfull right hand i intreat thee by the joyfull ceremonies of harvests by the quiet silence of thy chests by the winged chariots of dragons thy servants by the furrows of the sicilian earth the devouring wagon the clammy earth by the place of going down into cellars at the light nuptials of proserpina and returns at the light inventions of her daughter and other things which are concealed in her temple in the city eleusis in attica besides with the divers sorts of the names of the stars they command us to call upon them by the names of the intelligencies ruling over the stars themselves of which we shall speak more at large in their proper place they that desire further examples of these let them search into the hymns of orpheus then which nothing is more efficatious in naturall magick if they together with their circumstances which wise men know be used according to a due harmony with all attention but to return to our purpose such like verses being aptly and duly made according to the rule of the stars and being full of signification & meaning and opportunely pronounced with vehement affection as according to the number proportion of their articles so according to the form resulting from the articles and by the violence of imagination do confer a very great power in the inchanter enchanter and sometimes transfers it upon the thing inchanted enchanted to bind and direct it to the same purpose for which the affections and speeches of the inchanter enchanter are intended now the instrument of inchanters enchanters is a most pure harmoniacall spirit warm breathing living bringing with it motion affection and signification composed of its parts endued with sence and conceived by reason by the quality therefore of this spirit and by the celestiall similitude thereof besides those things which have already been spoken of verses also from the opportunity of time receive from above most excellent vertues and indeed more sublime and efficatious then spirits & vapors exhaling out of the vegetable life out of hearbs roots gums aromaticall things and fumes and such like and therefore magicians inchanting enchanting things are wont to blow and breath breathe upon them the words of the verse or to breath breathe in the vertue with the spirit that so the whole vertue of the soul be directed to the thing inchanted enchanted being disposed for the receiving the said vertue and here it is to he noted that every oration writting writing and words as they induce accustomed motions by their accustomed numbers and proportions and form so also besides their usuall order being pronounced or wrote backwards more unto unusuall effects chapter lxxii of the wonderful power of inchantments enchantments they say that the power of inchantments enchantments and verses is so great that it is believed they are able to subvert almost all nature as saith apuleius that with a magicall whispering swift rivers are turned back the slow sea is bound the winds are breathed out with one accord the sun is stopt the moon is clarified the stars are pulled out the day is kept back the night is prolonged and of these things sings lucan the courses of all things did cease the night prolonged was twas long before twas light astonied was the headlong world all this was by the hearing of a verse and a little before thessalian verse did into s heart so flow that it did make a greater heat of love and elsewhere no dregs of poison being by him drunk his wits decayd inchanted enchanted also virgil in damon charms can command the moon down from the skie circes charms changd ulisses ulysses company a cold snake being charmd burst in the meads and in another place charms bear corn standing from anothers farm and ovid in his book sine titulo saith with charms doth withring ceres dye dried are the fountains all acorns from okes oaks inchanted enchanted grapes and apples from trees fall if these things were not true there would not be such strict penall statutes made against them that should inchant enchant fruit and tibullus saith of a certain imchantress enchantress her with charms drawing stars from heaven i and turning th course of rivers did espy she parts the earth and ghosts from sepulchers draws up and fetcheth bones away from th fires and at her pleasure scatters clouds ith air and makes it snow in summer hot and fair of all which that inchantress enchantress seems to boast her self in ovid when she saith at will i make swift streams retire to their fountains whilest their banks admire sea toss and smooth clear clouds with clouds deform with spells and charms i break the vipers jaw cleave solid rocks oakes from their seasures seizures draw whole woods remove the airy mountains shake earth for to groan and ghosts from graves awake and thee o moon i draw moreover all poets sing and philosophers do not deny that by verses many wonderfull things may be done as corn to be removed lightenings to be commanded diseases to be cured and such like for cato himself in country affairs used some inchantments enchantments against the diseases of beasts which as yet are extant in his writings also josephus testifies that solomon was skilled in those kinds of inchantments enchantments also celsus africanus reports according to the egyptian doctrine that mans body according to the number of the faces of the zodiack signs was taken care of by so many viz thirty six spirits whereof each undertake and defend their proper part whose names they call with a peculiar voice which being called upon restore to health with their inchantments enchantments the diseased parts of the body chapter lxxiii of the vertue of writting writing and of making imprecations and inscriptions the use of words and speech is to express the inwards of the mind and from thence to draw forth the secrets of the thoughts and to declare the will of the speaker now writing is the last expression of the mind and is the number of speech and voice as also the collection state end continuing and iteration making a habit which is not perfected with the act of ones voice and whatsoever is in the mind in voice in word in oration and in speech the whole and all of this is in writing also and as nothing which is conceived in the mind is not expressed by voice so nothing which is expressed is not also written and therefore magicians command that in every work there be imprecations and inscriptions made by which the operator may express his affection that if he gather an hearb herb or a stone he declare for what use he doth it if he make a picture he say and write to what end he maketh it with imprecations and inscriptions albertus also in his book called speculum doth not disallow without which all our works would never be brought into effect seeing a disposition doth not cause an effect but the act of the disposition we find also that the same kind of precepts was in use amongst the ancients as virgil testifies when he sings i walk a round first with these threads in number which three are bout th altars thrice i shall thy image bear and a little after knots amaryllis tye tie of colours three then say these bonds i knit for venus be and in the same place as with one fire this clay doth harder prove the wax more soft so daphnis with our love chapter lxxiv of the proportion correspondency reduction of letters to the celestiall signs and planets according to various tongues and a table shewing this god gave to man a mind and speech which as saith mercurius trismegistus are thought to be a gift of the same vertue power and immortality the omnipotent god hath by his providence divided the speech of men into divers languages which languages have according to their diversity received divers and proper characters of writing consisting in their certain order number and figure not so disposed and formed by hap or chance nor by the weak judgement of man but from above whereby they agree with the celestiall and divine bodies and vertues but before all notes of languages the writing of the hebrews is of all the most sacred in the figures of characters points of vowels and tops of accents as consisting in matter form and spirit the position of the stars being first made in the seat of god which is heaven after the figure of them as the masters of the hebrews testifie are most fully formed the letters of the celestiall mysteries as by their figure form and signification so by the numbers signified by them and also by their various harmony of their conjunction whence the more curious mecubals of the hebrews do undertake by the figure of their letters the forms of characters and their signature simpleness composition separation crookedness directness defect abounding greatness litleness crowning opening shutting order transmutation joyning together revolution of letters and of points and tops by the supputation of numbers by the letters of things signified to explain all things how they proceed from the first cause and are again to be reduced into the same moreover they divide the letters of their hebrew alphabet viz into twelve simple seven double and three mothers which they say signifie as characters of things the twelve signs seven planets and three elements viz fire water and earth for they account aire no element but as the glew glue and spirit of the elements to these also they appoint points and tops as therefore by the aspects of planets and signs together with the elements the working spirit and truth all things have been and are brought forth so by these characters of letters and points signifying those things that are brought forth the names of all things are appointed as certain signs and vehiculas of things explained carrying with them every where their essence and vertues the profound meanings and signs are inherent in those characters and figures of them as also numbers place order and revolution so that origenes therefore thought that those names being translated into another idiome do not retain their proper vertue for only originall names which are rightly imposed because they signify naturally have a naturall activity it is not so with them which signifie at pleasure which have no activity as they are signifying but as they are certain naturall things in themselves now if there be any originall language whose words have a naturall signification it is manifest that this is the hebrew the order of which he that shall profoundly and radically observe and shall know to resolve proportionably the letters thereof shall have a rule exactly to find out any idiome there are therefore two and twenty letters which are the foundation of the world and of creatures that are and are named in it and every saying and every creature are of them and by their revolutions receive their name being and vertue he therefore that will find them out must by each joyning together of the letters so long examine them untill the voice of god is manifest and the framing of the most sacred letters be opened and discovered for hence voices and words have efficacy in magicall works because that in which nature first exerciseth magicall efficacy is the voice of god but these are of more deep speculation then to be handled in this book but to return to the division of the letters of these amongst the hebrews are three mothers viz alef vav yod seven double viz the other viz are simple the same rule is amongst the chaldeans and by the imitation of these the letters of other tongues are distributed to signs planets and elements after their order for the vowels in the greek tongue viz a e h i o u w answer to the seven planets b g d z k l m n p r s t are attributed to the twelve signs of the zodiack the other five q x f c y represent the four elements and the spirit of the world amongst the latine there is the same signification of them for the five vowels a e i u and j and v consonants are ascribed to the seven planets and the consonants b c d f g l m n p r s t are answerable to the twelve signs the rest viz k q x z make four elements h the aspiration represents the spirit of the world y because it is a greek and not a latine character and serving only to greek words follows the nature of its idiome but this you must not be ignorant of that it is observed by all wise men that the hebrew letters are the most efficacious of all because they have the greatest similitude with celestials and the world and that the letters of the other tongues have not so great an efficacy because they are more distant from them now the disposition of these the following table will explain also all the letters have double numbers of their order viz extended which simply express of what number the letters are according to their order and collected which recollect with themselves the numbers of all the preceding letters also they have integrall numbers which result from the names of letters according to their various manners of numbring numbering the vertues of which numbers he that shall know shall be able in every tongue to draw forth wonderfull mysteries by their letters as also to tell what things have been past and foretell things to come there are also other mysterious joynings of letters with numbers but we shall abundantly discourse of all these in the following books wherefore we will now put an end to this first book
