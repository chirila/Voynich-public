the prologue of a doctor in recommendacion of arystotle the prynce of phylosophers god almyghty save our kynge & the glory of all his frendes and conferme his realme in the faythe of god and cause hym to reygne in the exaltacyon prayse and honour of his people i whiche am servaunt to the kynge have put in execution the werke of his commaundement in getynge a boke of good maners to his governaunce the whiche boke is called the secrete of secretes made by the prince of phylosophers arystotle the sone of mahonnet of macedony to his dysciple the emperour alexander sone of phylyp kynge of macedony the which alexandre had two crownes this sayd boke arystotle compyled in the oldenesse of his body bycause that he might no more travayle nor ryde to do suche besynesses as alexander had put in to his charge for alexandre had made hym governour and mayster above all other bycause he was a man of veray good councell of grete clerge and subtyll understanding and incessantly studyed good & gracyous maners & scyences spyrytuall contemplatives and charytables he was a wyse man & meke lovynge reason and justyce & ever reported ryghtwysnesse & trouthe and therfore many phylosophres repute hym of the nombre of prophetes and say that they had founde dyvers bokes of the grekes which god had sent hym by his moost excellent aungell saynge to hym i shall make the to be called in the worlde more an aungell than a man and wyte ye that arystotle dyde in his lyfe many sygnes whiche were straunge in werkes & mervayles whiche were to longe to be accompted before his dethe he dyde many straunge werkes wherfore a relygyon & company peryadyc sayd & helde opynion that he had ben in heven in lykeness of a douve of fyre and as longe as he lyved alexander overcame all the worlde through his councell and all landes by the fame of hym were put under the imperyall commaundement & in lykewyse they of perce & araby and there was none that durst gaynsay alexander in worde nor dede and the sayd arystotle made many goodly epystles for the love that he had to alexander & for to cause hym to knowe all the secretes he made an epystle here under wryten the which he sent to alexander and whan alexander had overcome the realme of perce & set the moost of them in his prysons he sent an epystle to arystotle whiche foloweth an epystle that alexander sent to arystotle doctour of justyce & right noble phylosopher we sygnyfy to thy hygh wysdome that we have sen in the realme of perce many men whiche habounde gretly in reason & understondyng subtyl & penetratyfe wherfore al we have intencyon to put them to deth howbeit as thou semest best sygnyfy us by thy lettres an epystle that aristotle sent to alexander yf thou can moeve & chaunge the ayre frome the erth & water & the ordynaunce of thy cytees to accomplysshe thy pleasure yf thou cannot do it ceas of & do it not but governe them in thy goodnesse and exalt them in benygnyte and yf thou do thus i hope with the grace of god that they all shall be thy frendes to all thy good pleasures and commaundements and for the love that they shall have in the thou shalt peasybly reygne over them in grete vyctory and whan alexander had red this epystle he dyde after his councell and they of perce were more obedyent to hym than to ony other nacyon the prologue of a doctour named phylyp that translated this boke in to latyn phylyp that translated this boke in to latyn was a chylde of parys & was a veray wyse interpretour & understander of languages & he sayd thus i have not knowen nor seen tyme that the phylosophers have holpen or have ben acustomed to helpe or to make all werkes or all secretes but that i have sought nor have knowen by no man by whome i knewe that he had knowlegyng of the scryptures of phylosophers but i have vysited him unto the tyme that i came to the knowlege of councell the which was estulapideus & a man solytary & of grete abstynence and veray wyse in phylosophy to whom i meked me dylynently requyrynge hym hat he wolde shewe to me the scryptures of the knowlege of the sonne the whiche he gave unto me with a ryght good wyll and surely i founde as moche as i desyred & all that i had ben about a hole yere & wherfore i had longe tyme travayled and i thus havynge my desyre retorned home with grete ioye yeldyng thankes to god my creatour and than at the request of the moost noble kynge with grete study & labour i translated this boke out of greke language in to caldees tongue & syth in to the speche of araby the which boke the mooste wyse man arystotle made whiche andwered alwayes to all the requestes of kynge alexandre as more playnly appereth in this present boke an epystle sent to kyng alexandre by arystotle ryght glorious sone and ryghtwyse god conserve the in the walke of knowlegyng the ways of trouthe & vertues and withdrawe thy carnall and beestly desyres & conferme thy realme to his servyce & to thy honour letynge the wyte deere sone that i have receyved thyn epystle reverently & honourably as it apperteyneth and playnly have understande the grete desyre that thou hast that i were personally with the reprovynge me of that i care but lytel for thy besynesses for the which cause i have ordeyned & hasted me to make a boke for the the which shall weye & conteyne all my werkes supplyenge myn absence & defautes and shall be to the a ryght certayne rule & doctryne in all thynges that thou wyllest the whiche i will shew as i were presently with the dere son thou ought not to repreve nor blame me for thou knowest well that for no thynge of the worlde but that i would go to the and yf were not that i am so sore greved and laden with aege & weykenesse of my persone wherby in no wyse i can go to the and wyte thou that the thynge which thou hast demaunded of me and that thou so moche desyrest to knowe & have is the secretes that nature humaynes thought scantly can compryse nor susteyne how than may in the hert of mortall man be wryten or understande that thynge that he ought not to knowe and that thyng that is not behovefull nor covenable to be spoken of howbeit i am bounde by veray duety to answere to that that thou demaundest i shall never other thynge shewe the but that which is wryten in this boke for yf thou rede it dylygently and understande it playnly and that thou mayse knowe that is conteyned in it without doubt thou shalt have all that that thou desyrest for god shall gyve the suche grace suche understandynge and subtylte of grete wyt and scyence and also by the doctryne that i have gyven the afore tyme that by thy selfe thou mayst knowe & conceyve that whiche thou desyrest and the cause why that i have opened and related my secretes fyguratyvely & somewhat derkly & that i have put obscure examples and by fygures is that i doubt & feare moche that this boke sholde come to the handes of infect persones & in the power of arrogant & evyll folkes which myght knowe the secretes of god and god knoweth wel that they be not worthy certaynly i make grete doubt that i in this trespace not the wyll and the grace of god i do relate & dyscover this thynge as it hath ben revelate of god unto the wyte thou then ryght dere sone that i have dyscovered to the the thynges that ben to be hyd and yf thou dyscover these secretes thou shalt have shortly evyl fortunes and mayst not be sure frome grete harmes that shall be comynge towarde the but almyghty god kepe the & me from suche thynges & from all dyshonest thynges and after all these thynges have in thy mynde this noble & prouffytable doctryne that i make redy to the & intende to expose thy noble hert to informe it to thy grete solace as myrour of helth yf thou wylt apply the therto moost dere sone it behoveth every kyng to have two thynges to sustayne hym & his royalme but he maye not stedfastely have it but yf he have good & grete governaunce of them that ought to governe and he that reygneth so is obeyed one of his subgectes and his subgectes egally with one courage & by one selfe forme shalbe obedyent to the lorde for by the dysobedyence of the subgectes the power of the lorde is gretly feblysshed and yf the subgectes reygne the governaunce may nothyng do and i shall shewe the the cause wherfore the subgectes ben styred & couraged to obey theyr lorde two thynges ther is the one is outwarde & the other inwarde it is not longe syth i declared to the that that is outwarde that is to wyte whan the lorde spendeth wysely his rychesse among his subgectes and that he in them worke lyberalyte & that he gyve to echone as they be worthy and therwith the kynge behoveth to have a wyle wherof i shall make mencyon in the chapytre of vyces & helpes that is so wyte that the kynge ought to enforce hym to get the hertes of his subgectes by good werkes and this is the fyrst degre & foundacyon in doyng of his dedes by ij thynges one inward & the other outwarde the cause outwarde is that the kynge do & maynteyne justyce the possessions & rychesses of his subgectes & that he be pyteous & mercyfull the cause inwarde is that he honoure grete lerned men & that he have them for recommended for god hath recommended them theyr scyence and i recommende the this secrete pryncypally with dyvers other whiche thou shalt fynde in other chapytres of this boke wherein thou shalt fynde grete wysdome & doctrine & the content of the of the fynal cause wherby thou shalt fynde thy pryncypall purpose for in it thou shalt lerne the sygnyfycacyions of the wordes & obscurytees of the examples than thou shalt playnly & perfytely have that that thou desyrest wherfore pray to god moost wyse & gloryous kynge that he wyll lyghten thy reason & understandynge to thende that thou mayst knowe & perceyue the secretes of this scyence and in the same thou mayst be myn heyre & successour & that he wyl graunt the largenesse of goodes to gyve haboundaunce to the lyvyng of wyse men & studyentes with grace to knowe that which is dyfficyle & without the same nothyng can be done of the maner of kynges as touchyng largesse there be iiij maner of kynges there is a kynge that is lyberall to hym selfe & lyberall to his subgectes there is a kynge that is lyberall to hym selfe & havyng to his subgectes the ytalyens say that it is no vyce to a kynge that is havynge to hymselfe & lyberal to his subgectes the indyens say that the kyng is good that is hauyng to hymself & to his subgectes the percyens say the contrary & ben of opynyion that the kyng is not worthy that is not large to hymselfe & havyng to his subgectes but among all the kynges above sayd it is the worst & ought in no thynge to be praysed that is not liberall to hym selfe & to his subgectis for he that is havynge to hym selfe & to his subgectis his realme shall be clene destroyed that it behoveth us to enquere of the vertues & vyces abovesayd & to shew what thyng largesse is & wherin the errour of largesse lyeth & what harmes come for lacke of largesse it is evydent that the qualytees ben to be reproved whan they go fro the meane & be avarycyous or folysshe lyberall but yf thou wyll enquere or seke largesse regarde & consyder thy power and the tyme of the necessyte & the merytes of men and than thou aught to gyve as thy power wyll by measure to them that have nede & be worthy of it for he that gyveth other wyse he breketh the rule of largesse & synneth and he that gyveth his goodes to hym that hath no nede he getteth no thankes and al that he gyveth to them that be not worthy is lost and he that spendeth his goodes outragyously shall soone come to the wylde brymmes of poverte & is lyke hym that gyveth victory to his enemyes over hym but a kynge that gyveth his goodes mesurably to them that have nede is lyberall to himselfe and his subgectes and his realme shal come to grete prosperyte & his commaundement shalbe fulfylled and he that spendeth the goodes of his realme without ordre & gyueth to them that be not worthy & to them that have no nede such a kynge destroyeth his people & the comyn welthe & is not worthy to reygne as a kyng and the name of avaryce is an over foule name to a kyng & to moche harme cometh to his regall mageste therfore yf a kyng wyl reygne honourably hym behoveth not to have the one nor the other of these vyces that is to wyte that he be not to lyberall nor to coveytous and yf the kyng wyl be counceyled he ought with grete dylygence to pourvey him of a wyse man whiche shall be chosen amonge all other to whome he shall commyt his doynges of the realme & the gouernaunce of the rychesses of the same as they ought to be spent of largesse and avaryce and of many other vyces kynge alexander moost dere sone i tell the certaynly that yf ony make greter expence than his relme can susteyne that he enclyneth to folysshe largesse & avaryce suche a kynge without doubt shalbe destroyed but yf he inclyne to lyberalyre he shall have perpetuall glory of his realme yf he drawe hym fro takynge the goodes and possessyons of his subgectes and wyte thou dere sone that i fynde wryten of a grete doctour named hermogynes whiche sayth that the gretest & soverayne goodnesse bryghtnesse of understandyng & plente of lawe scyence & perfeccyon of a kynge is that it behoveth to kepe hym fro takynge of the goodes and possessyons of his subgectes it hath ben the undoynge of many realmes for dyvers kynges have made greter & outragyous expences than the stynt of theyr realmes coude extende wherfore they toke the goodes and landes of theyr subgectes for the whiche injuryes doynge the people cryed to god whishe sent vengeaunce on the sayd kynges in suche wyce that theyr people rebelled agaynst them & put them to destruccyon and without the grete mercy of god that susteyned them the realmes shold have ben utterly destroyed with the people thou then oughtest to absteyne the from outragyous expences & ought to kepe temperaunce in lyberalyte and gete not the derke secretnesse & reproches that thou shalt have for it belongeth not to them that be good of vertues & vyces & of the doctryne of arystotle the substaunce of all vertuous reygnyng is to gyve to them that be good & perdon injuryes honoure & bere reverence to them that be worthy & have mynde of them that be meke & amende the defawtes of them that be symple & with good wyl save the people & kepe the fro to moche spekyng let injuryes pass tyll thou se the tyme of defence that thou knowe not the foly of foles dere sone i have taught the & shal teche the many thynges the whiche thou shalt kepe in thy hert and i ensure the that the sayd techynges shall always be there in al thy doynges & werkes bryght & suffycyent scyence of physyke shortely comprysed thou shalt have and i wolde never have shewed the ony thynge but that the sayd scyence with the techynges that folowe ought to suffyse the & thy werkes in this worlde and in the other of the understandynge dere sone knowe thou that the understandynge is the chyef of the governaunce of man & helth of the soule keper of vertues & of vyces for in the says understandynge we beholde the thynges that be to be chosen it is the key of vertues & the rote of all laudable goodes and the best instrument therof is to have good fame and yf it be contraryly done it shalbe confounded at the last by yll fame a kynge ought pryncypally seke to have a good fame more for the governynge of his reame than for hymselfe of the fynall intencyon that a kynge ought to have for the begynnynge of largesse that a kynge ought to have is to have good fame wherby the grete realmes & grete lordysshyppes be goten and yf thou desyrest to get realmes of lordysshyppes yf it be not by good fame thou shalt get none other thynge but envy and envy bredeth lesynges whiche is mater and rote of all vyces envy bredeth yll speche yll speche bredeth hate hate bredeth injustyce injustyce bredeth batayle batayle breketh all lawe dystroyeth cytees and is contrary to nature than thynke dere sone & set thy desyre to get good fame and thou shalt have in the trouth & all thynges laudable for it is cause of al welth for it is contrary to lesynges whiche is mater of all vyces as it is sayd and trouth engendreth the desyre of justyce justyce engendreth good faythe good faythe engendreth famylyaryte famylyaryte engendreth frendshyp frendshyp engendreth councel and helpe and for this cause all the worlde was ordeyned & the lawes made which be covenable to reason and nature it appereth than that the desyre to have good fame is honourable and perdurable lyfe of evylles that folowe flesshely desyre alexander fayre sone leve thy beestly desyres of thy flesshly appetyte for they be corruptibles the flesshely desyres draweth thy hert to beestly corrupcyon of the soule without ony dyscrecyon & dryeth the body of man wotest thou what flesshely love bredeth it bredeth avaryce avaryce bredeth desyre desyre bredeth rychesse and maketh a man without care to be a proude man without lawe and a thefe theft bryngeth a man to shame and fynall destruccyon of his body of the wysdome and ordynaunce of a kynge it is behovefull and ryght that the good fame of a kynge be in honourable scyence and worthynesse throughout al realmes to be shed frome his realme and have communycacyon of theyr wyse councel with his and therby he shall be praysed honoured & doubted of his subgectes whan they se that he speketh and doth his werkes wysely for easely is perceyved the wysdome or foly of a kynge for whan he governeth hym in worthynesse towarde his subgectes he is worthy to reygne honourably but he that putteth his realme in servytude or thraldom of evyll customes he breketh the way of veryte and dyspyseth the good way and lawe of god and at the last be dyspraysed of all folkes as he hath deserved of the worthynes relygyon and holynesse of a kynge and yet agayne well beloved sone i tell the that the phylosophres have spoken and sayd it behoveth that the royall mageste be governed by ryghtwysnesse & not by faynt apparence but in dede to thende that every man may se and knowe clerely the goodnesse of a kynge and that he feare god and wyll be governed in godly wayes than shall he be honoured & doubted and yf he shewe hym selfe faynynge to be good and is nought to his subgectes his yll werkes can not be hyd nor it may not be but his people shall knowe it he shall be dyspysed of god & shamed in the worlde and his dedes shalbe lessed & the honoure of the crowne of his realme shall fayle what shall i tell the more there is no tresure in this world to good fame and moreover dere sone it besemeth that thou worshyp clerkes and poverte of good men of relygyon and exalt wyse men and speke oft with them and questyon often of doubtes with them and demaunde many thynges of them and answer wysely to theyr questyons and honoure noble men as eche of them is worthy of the pourveyaunce of a kynge it behoveth that a wyse kynge thynke often of thynges to come that he may provyde for suche thynges as be contrary to hym and that he may the easlyer bere the adversytees and contrary adventures and the kyng ought to be wysely hyd & refreyned to thende that without delyberacyon he come not to the dede that he purposed in his anger and he ought reasonably knowlege his anger and errour and appease hym selfe easely for the moost soverayne wysdome and vertue that a kynge may have is to rule himselfe wysely and whan he seeth ony thynge that is good and prouffytable for hym to be done he sholde do it with grete dylygence & dyscrecyon bycause the people shal not say that he hath done his besynesse folysshely or to neglygently of the vestymentes of a kynge it besemeth well to the mageste royall that the kynge be clothed honourably and that he shewe hymselfe alway in fayre and royall clothes and ought in beaute of robbes to surmount all other clothynge also he ought with grete prerogatyf & dygnyte use fayre deere & straunge vestures for therby is his dygnyte more excellent and his myght more exalted and more reverence is made to hym and also it besemeth a kynge to be fayre spoken with softe and kynde wordes specyally in tyme of warre of the countenaunce of a kynge swete sone alexander it is a goodly thyng precyous and honourable whan the kynge speketh but lytell but yf over grete nede requyre it it is better that the eeres of the people be wylling to here the wordes of a kynge than to be wery of his to moche spekyng for whan the eeres be glutted with the kynges speche theyr hertes be wery to se hym and also the kynge ought not to shewe hymselfe to often to his people nor haunt to moche the company of his subgectes & specyall of vylayns and therfore the yndyens have a good custome in the ordynaunce of theyr realme for theyr maner is that theyr kynge sheweth hymselfe but ones in the yere and than he is clothed in vesture royall and all the barons and knyghtes of his realme ben rychely armed and arayed about hym and he is set upon a stede the ceptre in his hande armed with ryche armures royalles and all his people a good way before the barons & other noble men and ther they shew the dyuers perylles & adventures that be passed and how that he & his councell is well ordred and the kynge as than is wonte to pardon grete offences to some of them and whan the parlyament is ended the kynge setteth hym in a chayre & anone ryseth one of the moost wysest men & speketh to the people praysyng & commendyng the wyt & good governaunce of the kynge in yeldynge thankes to god that hath so well ruled and maynteyned the yndyens kynge & that they are pourveyed of so wyse & honourable a kynge to reygne & guyde them and then he confermeth the sayd people in one wyl & courage to the obedyence of the kynge and then he commendeth the people & aloweth them gretly of theyr good maners & condicyons which be reporteth do them and sheweth them goodly wordes & examples the better to put them in grace & obeysaunce with mekenesse in the good wyll of the kynge and whan this wyse prynce hath thus spoken the people enforce them to exalte the praysynges and commendacyons and good maners of this sayd kynge in prayenge god hertely for hym and by this meane by theyr good maners and wysdome of theyr kyng they cause countrees and cytees to be obedyent to them and thus ben the chyldren brought up in theyr youth & taught in the honoure and revernence of the kynge and the good fame of the kynge secretly and manyfestly is spredde and knowen and the ryche and poore ben therby susteyned thoroughout the realme of ynde and the kynges possessyons and trybutes encreaseth therby of the justyce of a kynge a kynge ought to ordre hym soo that he do no wronge nor harme to marchauntes but ought to cherysshe them for they go thoroughout all the worlde and by them is reported the good and all renownes of lordes & prynces and a kynge ought by veray justyce to yelde every man his and so his landes and cytees shal be garnysshed with all welthes and the kynges werkes shall multyply to his honoure and glory and shal be the more redoubted of his foes and shall lyve & reygne at his wyl & desyre in quyetnesse of the worldly desyres of a kynge alexander ryght worthy sone coveyt not alwayes worldly thynges for they be corruptyble and thynke that thou must leave all demaunde than suche thynges as can not be corrupte that is the lyfe that can not chaunge and the relme perdurable and reyse thy thoughts in goodnesse and therin kepe the stronge & gloryous and leave the lyfe of bestes that alwaye lyve in theyr fylthynesse beleve not lyghtly al thynge that is tolde to the and be not enclyned to pardon them agaynst whome thou hast had vyctory and thynke of the tyme & of thynges that may happen for thou knowest what is to come and set not thy desyres in meates & drynkes in lechery nor to moche slepe nor in carnall desyres of the chastyte of a kynge soverayne emperour enclyne not to lechery of women for it is a swynysshe lyfe and no glory shall be to the yf thou governe the after the lyvynge of bestes without reason dere sone beleve me for without doubt lechery is destruccyon of the body the abregement & corrupcyon of all vertues the deth of a man self and maketh the man feminyne and at the last bryngeth hym to all evylles of the sportynge of a kynge sothly it is besemynge to a kynge to take his pastyme and sporte with his prynces and lordes and that he have many and dyvers maners of mynstrylles and syndry instrumentes daunces and songes for the humayne creature naturally anoyeth and in suche instrumentes and pastymes nature delyteth & the body taketh force & vygoure than yf thou wylt delyte in suche thynges do it the moost honestly & secretly that thou mayst and whan thou arte in thy pastymes beware for drynkynge of wyne and let the other sporte them as longe as they lust and than thou shalte have many secrets dysclosed and make not this pastyme often but twyse or thryse in the yere also it behoveth the to have nyghe to the some of thy famylyer servauntes that shal tel and reporte to the what is sayd in the realme and whan thou arte amonge thy barons & subgectes honoure wyse men & bere reverence to every man as they be worthy and every man in his estate mayntene & let them ete with the somtyme one after another and gyve gownes somtyme to one & somtyme to another after theyr estate and as they be worthy and in ony wyse se that there be none of thy knyghtes & famylyers but that he fele of thy lyberalyte & of thy grace and thus overall shall appere thy largesse & gretnesse of thy courage and honour of the dyscrecyon of a kynge most worthy sone it is good that a kynge have lyberalyte goodly gesture and countenaunce & that he laughe not to moche for overmoche laughyng causeth many to be lesse set by and to be lesse honoured and fynably overmoch laughyng maketh a person to seme older than he is also a kynge ought to love his people in his courte and of his councel more than in other partyes and yf ony do vylany to another he ought to punysshe hym as he hath deserved that other may take example therby and eschewe them from yll doynge and in that punysshynge thou ought to regarde the persone that hath done amysse for elles sholde a hyghe & noble man be punysshed as another and yf thou do so thou shalt not be alowed of the people and it is good somtyme to do rygorous & strayt justice & somtyme noe to thende not that dyfference of the persones be knowen for it is wryten in the boke of machabees that a kynge ought to be praysed & loved yf he be lyke the eygle which hath lorshyp over all fowles and not as he which wyll be lyke another foule that is subgecte to the eygle wherfore yf ony do vylany to ony other in the presence of the kynges mageste it ought to be regarded & consydered yf the offence were done in game or for to cause the kyng to laugh or to make hym or other glad of it or yf he dyde it in despyte & shame of the mageste royall for the fyrst dede he ought to be correcte and for the seconde to suffre dethe of the reverence of a kynge worthy kynge alexander dere sone the obedyence to a kynge cometh by iiij thynges that is for the vertuous lyvynge of the kynge bycause he maketh hym to be beloved of his subgectes bycause he is curteys and for the honoure and reverence that he doth to them that be moost worthy of it my dere sone do so moch that thou mayst drawe to the the courages of thy subgectes and avenge them of all wronges & injuryes done to them and beware that thou gyve not to thy subgectes cause and mater to speke agaynst the for speche of people many tymes may do hurt than have in thy mynde suche wyse that nothyng may be sayd agaynst the and so thou shall eschue the yll wyl and dedes of them that had yll wyll agaynst the and forsoth the largenesse of the glory of thy dygnyte and reverence and exaltacyon of thy realme and that reboundeth moost to thy honoure is to have the hertes of thy subgectes it is founde in holy scryptures that the kyng is over a realme as the rayne is over the erth which is the grace of god and blyssynge of the hevens and cometh on the erthe and all lyvynge creatures for the rayne is called the way of marchauntes and helpe of buylders how be it that in the rayne falleth somtyme thondre and lyghtnynge swellynge of the see and floodes with tempestes and many other evyls cometh therby wherwith medowes and verdures hath perysshed for god made it so of his grete goodnesse benygnyte and grace the which selfe example ye may fynde in wynter and somer in the whiche the soverayne largesse gyveth and ordeyneth coldenesse and heate engendrynge and encreasynge of all newe thynges how be it many evyls & perylles cometh by the rygour of grete coldenesse of wynter & grete heates of somer in lyke wyse dere sone is it of a kynge for many tymes the kynge doth many grefes and evylles to his subgectes and maketh them to beare grete herte agaynst hym but whan the people seeth that by the grace and good governaunce of the kynge they be in peas and well ruled they forgete the abovesayd evylles and thanke the gloryous god that hath pourveyed them of so wyse a kynge how the kynge ought to remembre his subgectes i requyre the swete sone that thou of thy goodnesse thynke and inquyre oftentymes of thy poore subgectes and knowe theyr necessytees and set amonge them suche men as be vertuous and that

enlumyned with the holy goost in his sapyence dyvyne and myghty and hath gyven them the gyftes of the scyence of these thynges here after folowynge that is to wyte they of ynde of grece and of athenes whiche phylosophres were just and perfyte and theyr wrytynges were the begynnynge of scyence & secretes for in theyr wrytynges is nothynge founde to be reproved nor splyt but approved of all wyse men of the governayle of seke people all wyse and naturall phylosophres say that man is made and composed of foure contrary humours the which have alway nede to be susteyned with meate and drynke the substaunce wherof behoveth to yssue and be corrupte yf ony do alway eate and drynke and he sholde waxe weyke and fall in grete dyseases and have many inconvenyences but yf he eate and drynke temperatly and reasonable he shall fynde helpe of lyfe strength of body and helth of all the members the wyse phylosophres saye that yf any man trespace the god of nature and the good maner of lyvynge be it in to moche eatyne and drynkynge or to moche slepynge or wakynge in to moche walkyng or restynge beynge to laxatyfe or to moche letynge of blode or to lytell it can not be but he must fall in

delectable thynges of the worlde be it in pleasure of the body it is but for to lyve the longer in them but for a more secrete ye ought to enforce you to do suche thynges as ben belongynge to longe lyfe & not to folowe the appetyte that is to wyte not to lye meate upon meat and dere sone i have herde often spoken of ypocras which kept many tymes dyete to thende that he myght lyve & endure the longer not for to lyve and endure for the meate & drynke also dere sone it is grete holsomnesse to be purged of superfluytees & evyll humours whiche ben in the body in how many maners a man may kepe his helthe good sone i praye the have in thy mynde stedfastly these certayne instruccyons and kepe them knowe thou that helth is chyefly in two thynges the fyrst is lete a man use suche meates & drynkes as he hath ben nourysshed with the seconde that he purge hym of yll humours that be corrupte & greve him for the body of man is fedde with meates & drynkes whiche nourysshe it by naturall heate that dryeth nouryssheth and fedeth the moystnesse therof of dyvers meates for the stomake whan the body is fat & full of vapours grosse meates is good for it & of the nourysshyng of suche a body the dygestyon is grosse & of grete quantyte for the great heate & vapours of the the body and whan the bodye is sklender & drye subtyll & moyste meates be good for it and the dygestion therof is of smal quantyte for the stryctnesses of the conduytes and it is grete wysdome & scyence for a man to use suche meates as been good & appertenent to his complexyon that is to wyte yf he fedde hym with hote meates temperatly but yf the heate be to grevous & brennynge within the body by over stronge wynes & hote meates or other accydentes than contrary meates & drynkes wyl do grete ease & prouffyte that is to wyte suche as ben colde of the stomake yf thy stomake be to hote than hote & cours meates be good for such a stomake is lyke a myghty fyre for to brenne gret weyght of logges but whan the stomake is colde & feble than it is good to have lyght & subtyle meates the sygnes to knowlege the stomake the sygnes of a stomake that is of an yll & weyke dygestyon is whan the body is unlusty hevy & slouthfull the face is swollen & yaneth often & hath payne in his eyen & bolketh often & rudely & the bolkyng is sowre & unsavery watry & stynkyng & therby is bredde wyndes & swellynge of the bely & the appetyte of meate is marde therfore swete sone beware of meates and drynkes that may hurte or be contrary to thy helth an epystle of grete value moost dere sone alexander sythe it is so that the body of man is corruptyble by dyversite of complexyon & of contrary humours that ben in it wherby often there cometh corrupcyon to it i thought to delyver the some thyng that shall be necessary & prouffytable to the in the whiche i wyll treate of the secretes of physyke whiche shall please the for certayne dyseases come to a kynge whiche be not honest to shewe to physycyens and yf thou wylt observe this lesson thou shalt have no nede of physycyens except in causes that may come in batayle the whiche may be exchewed alexander fayre sone whan thou rysest frome thy slepe walke and stretche

stenche of the mouth and clereth the voyce and gyveth appetyte to eate and rubbe thy heed often in the same wyse for it openeth the claustres of the brayne and thycketh the necke and other membres and clenseth the face and the syght and prolongeth stowpynge of aege and amendeth the blode also anoynt the somtyme with swete smellynge oyntementes as the tyme reqyreth for in suche swetenesse thy hert taketh grete pleasure & is nourysshed therby and the spyryt of lyfe taketh refeccyon in good odoures and the blode renneth meryly thrugh the vaynes of the body after that take somtyme an electuary of a wood called aloes and of rubarbe whiche is a precyous thynge to the pryce of foure pens which thou shalt fynde wryten in the boke of physyke and this shall do the moche good for it voydeth the heate of the mouth of the stomake and warmeth the body and wasteth wyndes and maketh good taste and savoure after this i councell the that thou be often with thy noble and wyse men of thy realme & speke to them of thy besynesses that thou hast to do and governe them sadly accordynge to theyr good customes of the maner to travayle or ever thou eate or thyn appetyte cometh at thyne houre accustomed do som travayle that is to wyte walke or ryde a lytell or do some other worke for it helpeth the body moche it voydeth all ventosytees and maketh the body lyghter stronger and lustyeth the stomake and wasted evyll humoures of the body and maketh the flewme of the stomake descende of the maner of eatynge fayre sone whan thy meate is set afore the eate of suche as thou desyrest moost resonably with well levayned breed and eate fyrst of such as ought to be fyrst eaten for there be to maners of dygestyon of meat in a man that is to wyte softe & harde for in the botom is moost heat for to make dygestion of meate bycause it is moost flesshly and nyghest the heat of the lyver wherwith the meate is soden and dygested of abstynence of meat whan thou eatest eate by leasure though thou have grete sppetyte to eate for yf thou eate gredely noughty humoures do multyply the stomake is laden the body is greved the hert is hurte and the meate remayneth in the stomakes botome undygested how pure water ought not to be drunken also beware dere sone that ye drynke no pure water specyally whan thou haste eaten meate but yf thou be wont therto for as soone as the water is upon the meate it coleth the stomake and quencheth the heate of the dygestyon and comforte of the meat it letteth dygestyon and greveth the body yf thou must nede drynke water alone take it the most temperately and as lytell as thou mayst of the maner to slepe whan thou hast taken thy refeccyon and hast luste to slepe lye downe on a softe bedde and slepe temperatly and fyrst lye downe on the lyfte syde and slepe theron a reasonable space for the lyfte syde is colde and hath nede to be warmeth and yf thou fele ony payn in thy bely or in thy stomake than lay therto a soverayne medycyne that is a warme lynnen cloth layde theron wyte thou dere sone that travayle is good and gyveth heate to the stomake but after dyner it is a noughty thynge for the meate abydeth undygested in the botome of the stomake and therof be bredde many dyseases and slepe before fedynge is not good for it maketh the body leane and dryeth the humoures but slepynge after fedynge is good for it fulfylleth the body & gyveth force & nourysshyng therto for whan the body of man resteth than the natural heat draweth the heat that was spredde in all the membres in to the botom of the stomake & syveth strength therto upon the refeccyon of the meat and heat requyreth rest therfore some phylosophres have sayd that it is better & holsomer to eat at nyght than in the mornyng for the eatyng in the mornynge bycause of the heat of the day greveth the stomake & the body is more travayled therwith and moreover the person shauffeth in travaylyng doynge his besynesse in goyng & spekyng & many other thynges that belongeth to the body of man by the which heat that is outwarde towarde none the naturall heat that is inwarde is weyked & appeyred & the meate is harde to dygest but at nyght it is more easy & lesse greved with the heat of traveyle and the hert & membres of man ben more in quyet by the coldnesse of the nyght that gyveth naturall heat to the stomake the kepyng of custome or wont thou shalt understande my dere sone that he that is wonte to eate but one meale often is dyseased for the stomake is without dygestyon & the body hath smal nourysshyng and he that is accustomed to eate at one time ones another tyme twyse he shal lyghtly preveve that it doth hym harme for custome chargeth nature how one ought to chaunge custome and yf nede constreyne the to chaunge thy custome do it wysely that is to wyte by lytel and lytell and so by the grace of god thy chaungynge shall be good but above al thynges beware that thou eate not tyle thou fele thy stomake empty and that it hath made good dygestyon of the fyrst meale and this thou mayst knowe by the desyre that thou shalt have to thy meate and by thy spatle that tornyth subtylly in thy mouthe and yf thou eate without nede or appetyte the heate of thy stomake shall be made colde as yse and yf necessyte be that thou must eate & have an appetyte therto the kynde heate of thy stomake wyll be as hote as fyre & of good dygestyon and beware that whan thy appetyte cometh that thou eate not forth with for it wyll gadre yll humours of thy body in to thy stomake whiche wyll hurte thy brayne and yf thou tary over longe or thou eate it wyl feble thy stomake & the meate wyll do thy body no good and yf so be that thou mayst not eate as soone as thy appetyte requyreth and that thy stomake be ful of yll humours do so that thou mayst vomyte or thou eate &

werkes and this is the fourme of understandynge the whiche god created and graunted to his creatures by justyce the erthe was made and kynges ordeyned to kepe and maynteyne justyce for it maketh subgectes meke and obedyent prowde men lowly and kepeth all persons in saufe fro wronges and domages and therfore they of ynde saye that the justyce of a good lorde is better than the rayne that

thy councelers nor lete them not knowe what is in thy wyll to do for yf thou shew thy mynde at the begynnynge thou shalt be dyspraysed than attempre thyn herte and thy wyll but here councel fyrst and manyfeste not that that lyeth at thy herte tyll thou come to put it in effecte consydre well the councell of every man and whiche of them hath juged thy mater and counceled the best for the and with the best love that he hath towards that and whan thou hast thus recorded thy councell put thy mynde in effecte without delay for the gretest destruccyon that may come to a kynge is to be slowe in his werkes and to lese tyme and yf so be that a yonge man of small estate gyve the good councell dyspyse it not for it is possyble that a man may be borne in suche constellacyon that naturally he shall have wysdome example there was upon a tyme a chylde borne in the partyes of ynde in the hous where this chylde was borne were certayne wyse men lodged whiche founde that the sayd childe was borne under such a constellacyon planet and sygne that he sholde be wyse meke courteys amyable fresshe of wytte and sholde be loved of kynges & grete lordes whiche thynge they wolde not shew to the fader which was a wever when the chyld came to aege the fader & moder set hym to theyr occupacion but he coude never lerne for ony beatyng nor chastysement at the last they lete him do as he lyst & he set his mynde to lerne scyences & the moevynges of the skyes & of all thynges above nature also he lerned good condycyons & maners to the governaunce of prynces & kynges and fynally by his wytte & wysdome he was ruler of all the countre another example in the realme of ynde were ii chyldren whan one of them came to aege the kyng set hym to scole for to lerne scyence & all the studyes of ynde & had the best techers in all the provynces for to teche him in all the spede that coude be possyble as to a kynges sone belonged but all the dylygences of his fader and other techers avayled nothynge nor coude make hym enclyne neyther by his mayster nor by his nature to lerne ony scyence nor arte but onely forgynge or smythes crafte wherof the kynge merveyled and sore troubled sent for all the wysest of his realme and demaunded of them how it myght be that his sone wolde lerne nothynge but onely smythes craft and they answered that the kynde of the chylde was of suche complexyon and that he was inclyned to that arte and to none other therefore dere sone alexander dyspyse no man of lowe byrthe nor of small stature yf thou se ony scyence or ony wysdome in hym and that he have also cood condycyons and maners in hym and dooth exchewe vyces suche one so wel manered is worthy to be loved of prynces and kynges and thou ought for to do nothynge without councell and i pray the dere sone that thou love hym that loveth trouthe & that counceleth the faythfully & somtyme contrary to thyn opynyon for suche a man is stedfast of courage faythfull & just to the & thy subgectes and the councel of such a man is good to the governayle of the kynge & of his realme forthermore lette not thy besynesses that sholde by fyrst done be the last &c but do every thynge by councell & ordre for councell is the shewer of all thynges to come it is behoveful therfore that thou do all thy werkes by councell of faythfull & secrete councelers for thy wysdom by the councell of them shall encrease as the see encreaseth by the ryvers & floodes that fall in to it and the better thou mayst wynne by the myght of warryours it is founde wryten that a grete wyse man of ynde wrote lettres to his sone in this wyse my well beloved sone it is behovefull that thou beleve councell in all thy besynesses for thou arte but one man take councel therfore of suche as thou knowest can gyve the good and above all thynges spare not

yf thou seme good & prouffytable accepte it & elles not and also i admosest the & councell the chefely that thou never make none of thy offycers thy lyeftenaunt onely nor gyve hym thy myght for his councel may destroy the thy realme & thy subgectes and seke alway to his own prouffyt & thy undoyng but thou ought to have dyvers offycers & yf thou wyll assay and prove ony of them thou must fayne that thou hast grete nede of money and yf he councel the to take of thy treasure & jewelles for to spende he loveth the and is faythful to the and yf he councell the to take the money of thy subgectes to make them poore he is corrupte & hateth the moche but yf he be such one that wyl offre the his own goodes and say syr by the gyfte and grace of god i have goten some goodes i gyve them to the suche

gyve credence to thy wordes and alowe thy saynge for wyse men wyll gladly gyve eeres to wyse and short informacyon and therfore be nor shamefast nor aferde to tell the trouth for many one have loste theyr ryght by shamefastnesse and feare of theyr utteraunce of wordes though theyr causes were good the maner of angre thou oughtest not to be angry through thy brother or frende as shew the hevy chere somtyme for peradventure he hath some cause wherfore he can shew the nor none other good chere or countenaunce and so it is with hym and yf thou hast had ony wordes with ony man and he shewe the yll countenaunce therfore yet thou ought not to be angry with hym for perchaunce he is too lewde or unwytty of hymselfe that he can do no better and yet he weneth that he doth wel for ever the lewdest sheweth moost anger for whan a wyse man is angry he sheweth it not outwarde by his reason a man ought more to feare the anger of a wyse man than of a foole for the wyse man can better revenge his angre than a foole howbeit that a foles angre is often comberous to uttre secretes in one maner only thou ought to shew thy secretes that is to wyte to almyghty god that knoweth al thyng that is to be understande to his lyftenaunt in erth and other wyse not for yf thou dyscover it to thy frende and yf thy frende be but lewde & hath another frende that he loveth to whome he telleth hym the same and so frome one to another tyll a grete meyny do knowe it & so thy secrete may come out to thy grete shame and rebuke for whyles thou kepest thy secret within the it is sure for thou mayst shew thy

for ony nede that thou hast to dyscover it take hede to whom but yf it be to suche one that for ony anger that thou doost to hym wyl not rebuke the with it and hever lete thy neyghboure knowe thy nede for therby thou mayest be the lesse set by in places where thou dwellest how thou oughtest to sporte with thy frende loke wysely how thou playest or bourdest with thy frende or other with thy handes or with thy mouth for yf thou do hym harme harme may come to the with sportyng with handes cometh angre and murdre whyther it be thy brother or frende for yf thou hurt hym or wryng his hande or cast hym downe or smyte hym otherwyse it shall greve hym & shame hym in his mynde albeit that he be lytell and weyke for eche in hym selfe counteth hym stronge bolde and fyers and yet he wyll prayse hym selfe thoughe he be a cowarde and nought and yf thou mocke hym thou shalt spyte hym to the hert for he wyll thynke that thou dyspysest hym & that thou reputeth hym at nought and yf thou mocke hym before people thou doost hym yet more spyte & he cometh angre and grete hate though it be thy brother or other frende but thou ought to pastyme with fayre wordes and to shewe goodly auctorytees and reasons to drawe theyr love to the for by that pastaunce thou mayst come to the goodnesse love and curteysy of people the maner to doubt and trust thyn enemy whyther thyn enemy be stronge or weyke thou ought not to doubt hym to moche nor trust to moche to hym for he that is overcome today may be vyctour tomorow and he that is vyctour today may be overthrowen to morow and he that doubteth none none will have doubt of hym to moch doubt maketh to moch trust and to moch trust maketh to moche domage for he that bereth doubt alwaye with hym hath a grete burden & payne and he that trust in hym
